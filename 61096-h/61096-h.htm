<p class="drop-capy">The following pages are based on personal
observations during two visits
to Kimberley, in 1896 and 1905, and on
personal researches on the formation and
artificial production of diamonds. In 1896
I spent nearly a month at Kimberley,
when Mr. Gardner F. Williams, the General
Manager of the De Beers Consolidated
Mines, and the managers of neighbouring
mines, did their utmost to aid in
my zealous quest for reliable information.
They gave me free access to all workings
above and below ground, allowed me to
examine at leisure their stock and to take
extracts from their books. I had exceptional
opportunities of studying the geology
of the Diamond and of noting the strange
cataclysmal facts connected with the birth,
growth, and physics of the lustrous stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1905 with my wife I returned to Kimberley.
We were members of the British
Association which held its meeting that year
in South Africa. I was asked to give one of
the Association lectures at Kimberley and
it was natural for me to discourse “On
Diamonds.” During our stay we were the
guests of Mr. Gardner Williams.</p>

<p>Returning to England after the visit of
1896, I gave two lectures on Diamonds at
the Imperial Institute and one at the Royal
Institution. These lectures, and the lecture
delivered at Kimberley, in 1905&mdash;hitherto
only privately distributed&mdash;form the basis
of the present volume. On each visit I
took abundant photographs, many of which
I now reproduce. A few are copied from
plans lent by Mr. Gardner Williams and
one or two are from photographs purchased
at Kimberley.</p>

<p>In obtaining statistical information of the
Diamond industry, I owe much to the Annual
Reports of the De Beers Company. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
also quoted freely from Reunart’s valuable
book on <cite>Diamonds and Gold in South Africa</cite>;

authors of the following papers and memoirs.</p>

<p>In the present volume I have tried to give
some idea of the underground wonders of
the Kimberley mines. I have pictured the
strenuous toil of the men who bring to the
surface the buried treasures, and I have
given some idea of the skill and ingenuity
with which their labours are controlled.
I have done my best to explain the fiery
origin of the Diamond, and to describe the
glowing, molten, subterranean furnaces
where they first begin mysteriously to take
shape. I have shown that a diamond is the
outcome of a series of Titanic earth convulsions,
and that these precious gems
undergo cycles of fiery, strange, and potent
vicissitudes before they can blaze on a ring
or a tiara.</p>

<p>I am glad to have paid these two visits
to South Africa. I always recall with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
interest the dusky smiling natives at work
and at play. I am glad to have seen that
Arabian Nights vision, the strong-room of
the De Beers Company. Above all, I have
vividly graven on my heart the friendly
welcome, and the innumerable acts of kindness
shown us by our able, energetic, and
enterprising Colonial fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">From the earliest times the diamond
has fascinated mankind. It has
been a perennial puzzle&mdash;one of the “riddles
of the painful earth.” It is recorded
in <cite>Sprat’s History of the Royal Society</cite> (1667)
that among the questions sent by order
of the Society to Sir Philiberto Vernatti,
Resident in Batavia, was one inquiring
“Whether Diamonds grow again after
three or four years in the same places where
they have been digged out?” The answer
sent back was, “Never, or at least as the
memory of man can attain to.”</p>

<p>In a lecture “On Diamonds,” fifty years
ago,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Professor Maskelyne said, “The diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is a substance which transcends all
others in certain properties to which it
is indebted for its usefulness in the arts
and its beauty as an ornament. Thus, on
the one hand, it is the hardest substance
found in nature or fashioned by art. Its
reflecting power and refractive energy, on
the other hand, exceed those of all other
colourless bodies, while it yields to none in
the perfection of its pellucidity.” He was
constrained to add, “The formation of the
diamond is an unsolved problem.”</p>

<p>Diamonds are found in widely separated
parts of the globe. In the United States
they have been found in Arkansas, where
the work of testing the deposits is now
going on steadily and quietly. The general
geology and petrography of the area and
the weathering of the peridotite are described
in a paper read before the American
Institute of Mining Engineers by Messrs.
Kunz and Washington. In tests made with
a diamond drill the peridotite was proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to depths of 200 feet. The green and
yellow grounds underlying the layer of
black, sticky soil are found to extend down
40 feet in places, and are estimated to
average 20 feet in depth over the area.
The outcrop of the peridotite is estimated
to cover about 40 acres, and may be larger.
Some 540 diamonds have been found, with
an aggregate of 200 carats. The largest
stone weighs about 6·5 carats, though the
average size compares favourably with the
general run of most of the South African
mines. There is a large proportion of white
stones, many of which are free from flaws
and are very brilliant. The genuineness of
the occurrence of diamonds in their matrix
is again proved, one stone having been
found imbedded in the green ground at a
depth of 15 feet. This peridotite has the
form of a volcanic pipe, and therefore its
outcrop is limited to one place.</p>

<p>In California authentic finds of diamonds
are recorded in Butte County, especially at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Cherokee, above Orville. These diamonds,
however, have come from alluvial deposits
and have been found generally in washing
for gold. As yet no authenticated discovery
of diamond in its original matrix in California
is recorded.</p>

<p>In Brazil the diamond industry has been
increasing of late years, and the old mines
in the Diamantina country are being
worked by American capital and by the
American methods which have proved so
successful at De Beers. It is estimated that
the annual value of the diamonds exported
from Brazil amounts to over £800,000, but
it is impossible to arrive at accurate figures
owing to the large quantities smuggled out
of the country to avoid payment of the
export tax.</p>

<p>British Guiana produces a small quantity
of diamonds, mostly, however, of small size.
Between January and September, 1907,
1564 carats were exported.</p>

<p>Indian diamonds chiefly come from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
states of Panna, Charkhari, and Ajaigarh.
In 1905 India exported 3059 carats, valued
at £5160.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cape Colony</span></h3>

<p>It is a standing surprise to the watchful
outsider how little attention is bestowed
on some of our colonies. For instance, to
the Cape Colony, comprising vast, varied,
and productive regions, we have till recently
manifested profound ignorance and consequent
indifference. When the Cape Colony
was first incorporated with the Empire, it
was pronounced “a bauble, unworthy of
thanks.” Yet before the Suez Canal and
the Waghorn overland route to India, the
Cape, as commanding our road to India,
Australia, and China, had a special importance.
Even now it presents an alternative
route which under conceivable circumstances
may be of capital moment.</p>

<p>The high grounds above Cape Town are
rich in medicinal health-giving waters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
districts where these springs occur are high-lying,
free from malaria, and admirably
adapted for the restoration of invalids. It
needs only some distinguished power to set
the fashion, some emperor, prince, or
reigning beauty to take the baths and
drink the waters, and the tide of tourists
would carry prosperity to Aliwal North,
Fraserburg, Cradock, and Fort Beaufort.</p>

<p>South Africa, as I shall endeavour to show
in detail, is the most important source of
diamonds on the earth, and ranks with
Australia and California as one of the three
great gold-yielding regions. But the wealth
of South Africa is not only in its gold and
diamonds. The province of Natal contains
more coal than Britain ever owned before
a single bucket had been raised, and the
beds extend over the Orange River Colony,
whilst valuable iron ores exist also in large
quantities.</p>

<p>In the year 1896 I spent nearly a month
at Kimberley. Mr. Gardner F. Williams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
General Manager of the De Beers Consolidated
Mines, and the Managers of neighbouring
mines, did their utmost to assist
me in my inquiries and to ply me with
valuable information. I had full access to
all the workings, above and below ground,
and was able to examine at leisure their
stock and take extracts from their books.</p>

<p>Again, in the year 1905, I paid another
visit to Kimberley as the guest of Mr.
Gardner Williams on the occasion of the
meeting of the British Association in South
Africa.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">River Washings</span></h3>

<p>Besides the matrix mines, where the
stones are found in pipes supposed to be of
volcanic origin, the alluvial deposits on the
Vaal River are of considerable importance.
The terraces and gravels along the Vaal
River for about 200 miles have been worked
for diamonds, the deposits sometimes extending
several miles on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
river, and varying from a few inches to 40
or 50 feet in thickness. The diamonds are
found almost everywhere through the gravel
deposit.</p>

<p>Before describing the present mode of
diamond extraction followed in the important
mines, I will commence with these
“River Washings,” where, in their primitive
simplicity, can be seen the modes of
work and the simple machinery long since
discarded in the large centres of the industry.
The drift or so-called “river washings”
present a very interesting phase of diamond
industry. The work is carried on in the
primitive fashion adopted in the early days
of diamond discovery, every man working
on his own little claim, assisted by a few
natives, and employing primitive machinery
(<a href="#P_010">Fig. 1</a>). The chief centre of the Vaal River
washings is about 30 miles to the north-west
of Kimberley, at a place called Klipdam
No. 2. There was originally a Klipdam a
few miles further, and here the miners congregated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
but the exhaustion of their claims
made them migrate to others not far off and
reported to be richer. Here, accordingly,
they re-erected their iron houses and called
it Klipdam No. 2.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to speak of “river washings.”
The diamantiferous deposits are not
special to the old or recent river bed,
but appear to be alluvial deposits spread
over a large tract of country by the agency
of water, which at some period of time
subsequent to the filling up of the volcanic
pipes planed off projecting kopjes from
the surface of the country and scattered
the debris broadcast over the land to the
north-west of Kimberley. The larger diamonds
and other heavy minerals would
naturally seek the lowest places, corresponding
with the river bed, past and present.
The fact that no diamonds are found in
the alluvial deposits near Kimberley may
perhaps be explained by supposing that the
first rush was sufficiently strong to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the debris past without deposition, and
that deposition occurred when the stream
slackened speed. At Klipdam No. 2 the
diamantiferous earth is remarkably like
river gravel, of a strong red colour&mdash;quite
different from the Kimberley blue ground&mdash;and
forms a layer from 1 to 8 feet thick,
lying over a “hard pan” of amygdaloidal
trap, the melaphyre of the Kimberley
mines.</p>

<p class="right">To face p. 10.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When I was at Klipdam the miners had
congregated at a spot called “New Rush,”
where some good finds of diamonds had
been reported. The gravel is dug and put
into a machine resembling the gold miner’s
dolly, where it is rocked and stirred by rakes,
with a current of water flowing over it.
Here all the fine stuff is washed away and
a rough kind of concentration effected.
The residual gravel is put on a table and
sorted for diamonds&mdash;an operation performed
by the master. At one of the claims
where work was proceeding vigorously I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
asked the proprietor to let me be present
at the sorting out, as I should like to see
river diamonds. He willingly consented,
but no diamonds were to be found. On my
expressing regret, he said he had not seen a
diamond for a fortnight! I remarked that
the prospect was rather a poor one, but he
told me that a fortnight before he picked
out one worth £300, “and that,” he said,
“will pay for several weeks’ wages of my
boys.” This is the kind of speculative
gambling that goes on at the river diggings.
The miner may toil fruitlessly for months,
and then come across a pocket of stones,
where they have been swept by some eddy,
by which he will net several thousands.
Diamonds from the “river washings” are
of all kinds, as if contributed by every
mine in the neighbourhood. They are
much rolled and etched, and contain a good
proportion of first-class stones; they are
of very good quality, as if only the better
and larger stones had survived the ordeal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
knocking about. Diamonds from the drift
fetch about 40 per cent more than those
from Kimberley; taking the yield of the
Kimberley and De Beers mines as worth
all round, large and small, 26s. 6d. a carat,
those from the drift are worth 40s.</p>

<p>As a rule the better class of natives&mdash;the
Zulus, Matabeles, Basutos, and Bechuanas&mdash;when
well treated, are very honest
and loyal to their masters. An amusing
instance of the devotion of a Zulu came to
my knowledge at Klipdam. He had been
superintending a gang of natives on a small
claim at the river washings. It yielded but
few stones, and the owner&mdash;my informant&mdash;sold
the claim, handing over the plant and
small staff, our friend the Zulu remaining
to look after the business till the new owner
took possession. In the course of a few
months the purchaser became dissatisfied
with his bargain, not a single diamond
having turned up since the transfer. One
night the Zulu came to his old master in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mysterious manner, and laying a handful
of diamonds on the table, said, “There,
Baas, are your diamonds; I was not going
to let the new man have any of them!”</p>

<span class="fs80 bold">KIMBERLEY AND ITS DIAMOND MINES</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The famous diamond mines in the
neighbourhood are Kimberley, De
Beers, Dutoitspan, Bultfontein, and Wesselton
(<a href="#P_010x">Fig. 2</a>). They are situated in latitude
28° 43´ South and longitude 24° 46´ East.
Kimberley is practically in the centre of the
present diamond-producing area. Besides
these mines others of some importance of the
Orange River Colony are known as Jaggersfontein
and Koffyfontein, Lace, and Monastery,
besides two new mines, the Roberts-Victor
and the Voorspoed.</p>

<p>The areas of the mines are:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="70%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Kimberley</td><td class="tdl">33 acres</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1907 the total number of carats raised
from these mines was more than two
million and a half, the sales of which realised
£6,452,597.</p>

<p>The most important mine outside the
Kimberley group is the new Premier Mine,
about 20 miles West-North-West of Pretoria,
where the famous Cullinan diamond
was found.</p>

<p>Other diamond mines are the Frank
Smith, Wesselton, the Kamfersdam, the
Kimberley West, the Newlands, and the
Leicester Mine.</p>

<p>The surface of the country round Kimberley
is covered with a ferruginous red,
adhesive, sandy soil, which makes horse
traffic very heavy. Below the red soil is a
basalt, much decomposed and highly ferruginous,
from 20 to 90 feet thick, and
lower still from 200 to 250 feet of black
slaty shale containing carbon and iron
pyrites. These are known as the Kimberley
shales; they are very combustible, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
part of the De Beers Mine where they were
accidentally fired they smouldered for
over eighteen months. Then follows a bed
of conglomerate about 10 feet thick, and
below the conglomerate about 400 feet of a
hard, compact rock of an olive colour, called
“Melaphyre,” or olivine diabase. Below
the melaphyre is a hard quartzite about
400 feet thick. The strata are almost
horizontal, dipping slightly to the north;
in places they are distorted and broken
through by protruding dykes of trap.
There is no water nearer than the Vaal
River, about 14 miles away, and formerly
the miners were dependent on rain-water
and a few springs and pools. Now, however,
a constant and abundant supply of
excellent water is served to the town,
whilst good brick houses, with gardens and
orchards, spring up on all sides. To mark
the rate of progress, Kimberley has an
excellent club and one of the best public
libraries in South Africa. Parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
town, affectionately called “the camp”
by the older inhabitants, are not beyond
the galvanised iron stage, and the general
appearance is unlovely and depressing.
Reunert reckons that over a million trees
have been cut down to supply timber for
the mines, and the whole country within a
radius of 100 miles has been denuded of
wood with the most injurious effects on the
climate. The extreme dryness of the air,
and the absence of trees to break the force
of the wind and temper the heat of the sun,
probably account for the dust storms so
frequent in summer. The temperature in
the day frequently rises to 100° in the
shade, but in so dry a climate this is not
unpleasant, and I felt less oppressed by this
heat than I did in London the previous
September. Moreover, in Kimberley, owing
to the high altitude, the nights are always
cool.</p>

<p>The approach to Kimberley is deadly
dull. The country is almost treeless, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the bare veldt stretches its level length,
relieved only by distant hills on the horizon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Pipes or Craters</span></h3>

<p>The five diamond mines or craters are all
contained in a circle 3½ miles in diameter.
They are irregularly shaped round or oval
pipes, extending vertically downwards to
an unknown depth, retaining about the
same diameter throughout (<a href="#P_018">Fig. 3</a>). They
are said to be volcanic necks, filled from
below with a heterogeneous mixture of fragments
of the surrounding rocks, and of older
rocks such as granite, mingled and cemented
with a bluish-coloured, hard clayey mass,
in which famous blue clay the imbedded
diamonds are hidden.</p>

<div class="caption">
FIG. 4. SECTION OF KIMBERLEY MINE.<br />
<p class="right">To face p. 18.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The craters or mines are situate in
depressions, which have no outlets for the
water which falls upon the neighbouring
hills. The watersheds of these hills drain
into ponds, called pans or vleis. The water,
which accumulates in these ponds during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the rainy season, evaporates during the
dry months, only one of them holding
water throughout the dry season. The
rocks which surround the craters are capped
by red soil or calcareous tufa, and in places
by both, the red soil covering the tufa.</p>

<p>The diamantiferous breccia filling the
mines, usually called “blue ground,” is a
collection of fragments of shale, various
eruptive rocks, boulders, and crystals of
many kinds of minerals. Indeed, a more
heterogeneous mixture can hardly be found
anywhere else on this globe. The ground
mass is of a bluish green, soapy to the touch
and friable, especially after exposure to the
weather. Professor Maskelyne considers it
to be a hydrated bronzite with a little
serpentine.</p>

<p>The Kimberley mine is filled for the first
70 or 80 feet with what is called “yellow
ground,” and below that with “blue ground”
(<a href="#P_018x">Fig. 4</a>). This superposed yellow on blue is
common to all the mines. The blue is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
unaltered ground, and owes its colour chiefly
to the presence of lower oxides of iron.
When atmospheric influences have access to
the iron it is peroxidised and the ground
assumes a yellow colour. The thickness of
yellow earth in the mines is therefore a
measure of the depth of penetration of air
and moisture. The colour does not affect
the yield of diamonds.</p>

<p>Besides diamonds, there have been detected
more than eighty species of minerals
in the blue ground, the more common
being magnetite, ilmenite, garnet, bright
green ferriferous enstatite (bronzite), a
hornblendic mineral closely resembling
smaragdite, calc-spar, vermiculite, diallage,
jeffreysite, mica, kyanite, augite, peridot,
eclogite, iron pyrites, wollastonite, vaalite,
zircon, chrome iron, rutile, corundum, apatite,
olivine, sahlite, chromite, pseudobrookite,
perofskite, biotite, and quartz. The
blue ground does not show any signs of passing
through great heat, as the fragments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the breccia are not fused at the edges. The
eruptive force was probably steam or
water-gas, acting under great pressure, but
at no high temperature. According to
Mr. Dunn, in the Kimberley Mine, at a
depth of 120 feet, several small fresh-water
shells were discovered in what appeared
to be undisturbed material.</p>

<p>A selection of thin sections of some of
these rocks and minerals, mounted as
microscopic objects and viewed by polarised
light, are not only of interest to the geologist,
but are objects of great beauty.</p>

<p>The appearance of shale and fragments of
other rocks testify that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mélange</i> has
suffered no great heat in its present condition,
and that it has been erupted from
great depths by the agency of water vapour
or some similar gas.</p>

<p>The rock outside the pipes and encasing
them is called “reef.” Inside some of the
mines occur large masses of “floating
reef,” covering an area of several thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
square feet. In the De Beers Mine is what
is called “the snake,” a dyke of igneous
rock taking a serpentine course across the
mine, and standing like a vein nearly
vertical, varying in thickness from 2 to 7
feet. The main body of the blue ground
is entirely analogous to the snake rock,
naturally more decomposed, but in essential
points the microscopic appearance of
the blue ground and of the “snake” is in an
extraordinary degree alike. Mr. Gardner
Williams supposes that the “snake” is a
younger eruptive formation coming from
the same volcanic source as the blue ground.
No diamonds have been found either in
the “snake” or the floating reef. The
ground, however, is generally richer in
diamonds in the neighbourhood of the
floating reef.</p>

<p>Before the discovery of the mines there
was nothing in the superficial appearance of
the ground to indicate the treasures below.
Since the volcanic ducts were filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the diamantiferous ground, denudation has
planed the surface and the upper parts of
the craters, and other ordinary signs of
volcanic activity being smoothed away,
the superficial and ubiquitous red sand
covered the whole surface. The Kimberley
Mine seems to have presented a slight
elevation above the surrounding flat country,
while the sites of other mines were level or
even slightly depressed. The Wesselton
Mine, within a mile of Dutoitspan, has only
been discovered a few years. It showed a
slight depression on the surface, which had
been used as a shoot for dry rubbish.
There are other diamantiferous pipes in
the neighbourhood, but they are small and
do not contain stones in payable quantities.
More recently another diamantiferous pipe
has been discovered about 40 miles off,
near Klipdam, and is now worked as the
Leicester Mine. Other hoards of diamonds
may also be near; where there are no surface
signs, and the pipe itself is hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
under 10 or 20 feet of recent deposits, it is
impossible to prospect the entire country.
Accident has hitherto been the chief factor
in the discovery of diamond mines.</p>

<p>How the great pipes were originally
formed is hard to say. They were certainly
not burst through in the ordinary manner
of volcanic eruption, since the surrounding
and enclosing walls show no signs of igneous
action, and are not shattered or broken
up even when touching the “blue ground.”
It is pretty certain these pipes were filled
from below after they were pierced and
the diamonds were formed at some previous
time and mixed with a mud volcano,
together with all kinds of debris eroded
from the rocks through which it erupted.
The direction of flow is seen in the upturned
edges of some of the strata of shale
in the walls, although I was unable to see
any upturning in most parts of the walls
of the De Beers Mine at great depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Kimberley Mine in Old Days</span></h3>

<p>According to Mr. Paterson, who examined
the diamond fields of Kimberley
soon after their discovery, “Wherever the
diamond is obtained perfect in form and
smooth in finest smoothness of surface,
without depression, hump, or twist of any
kind, such diamonds were ever found in
their own little moulds of finest limey
stuff,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and as if such mould of lime had
been a necessity to their perfect formation.
And further, where the splinters of diamonds,
or boarty stuff, were chiefly met by
the diggers, there was much less presence
of limey matter in the claim at the section
of it where such broken or fragmentary
diamonds were found; and that chiefly
from among what the diggers termed
‘clay-ballast,’ or ‘burnt brick,’ were unearthed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the bits or undeveloped crystals so
plentiful at New Rush.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In the first days of diamond mining
there was no idea that diamantiferous
earth extended to any particular depth,
and miners were allowed to dig holes at
haphazard and prospect where they liked.
When the Kimberley Mine was discovered
a new arrangement was made, and in July,
1871, it was cut up into about 500 claims,
each 31 feet square, with spaces reserved
for about fifteen roadways across the mine.
No person at first could hold more than two
claims&mdash;a rule afterwards modified.</p>

<p>The following quotation from a description
of a visit to Kimberley in 1872, by Mr.
Paterson, taken from a paper read by him
to the Geologists’ Association, gives a
graphic picture of the early days of the
Kimberley Mine:</p>

<p>“The New Rush diggings (as the Kimberley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Mine was at first called) are all going
forward in an oval space enclosed around
by the trap dyke, and of which the larger
diameter is about 1000 feet, while the
shorter is not more than 700 feet in length.
Here all the claims of 31 feet square each
are marked out with roadways of about
12 feet in width, occurring every 60 feet.
Upon these roadways, by the side of a
short pole fixed into the roadway, sits the
owner of the claim with watchful eye upon
the Kafir diggers below, who fill and hoist,
by means of a pulley fixed to the pole
above, bucketful after bucketful of the
picked marl stuff in which the diamonds
are found.</p>

<p>“Many of the claims are already sunk
to a depth of 100 feet, and still the diamonds
continue to be found as plentifully
as ever. From the roadway above the
marl is carted away to the sorting-tables,
outside the range of the diggings, among
mounds of marl stuff which seem like little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
hills. Here, amidst such whirls of dust as
are nowhere else seen, the marl stuff is
pounded, sifted from the finest powder of
lime and clay, and from the residue put
on the sorting-tables, the diggers, with a
piece of zinc 9 inches long by 4 inches in
breadth, search out in the successive layers
taken from the heap the precious gems.
I need not tell you that the search is by no
means very perfect, or that perhaps as
many diamonds escape the digger’s eye as
are discovered and taken out by him, but
you will perhaps confess with me that their
aptness in picking out the diamonds is by
no means to be despised, when I tell you
that in one six months from the date
of opening New Rush diggings, little short
of a million sterling in diamonds has been
extracted from them. At close of day the
diggers take daily stock of their finds, and
between five and six o’clock in the afternoon
are to be seen hundreds and hundreds
moving through the main street of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Rush on visits to the tents of the buyers,
seated behind their little green baize tables,
with scales all ready, and bags of gold and
silver and piles of banknotes, to buy the
little gems.”</p>

<p>It may help to realise the enormous
value of the Kimberley Mine if I say that
two claims, measuring together 62 by 31
feet and worked to a depth of 150 feet,
yielded 28,000 carats of diamonds.</p>

<p>The roadways across the mine soon,
however, became unsafe. Claims were sunk
100 or 200 feet each side of a roadway,
and the temptation to undermine roadways
was not always resisted. Falls of
road frequently took place, followed by
complete collapse, burying mine and claims
in ruin. At that time there were probably
12,000 or 15,000 men at work in the mine,
and then came the difficulty how to continue
working the host of separate claims
without interference with each other. A
system of rope haulage was adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The following description of the work at
the Kimberley Mine at this stage of its
history is given by Mr. Reunert:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“A succession of tall, massive timber
stagings was erected round the margin of
the mine. Each staging carried two or
three platforms one above the other, every
platform serving as an independent level
from which to communicate with the
claims below. Stationary ropes were then
stretched from the different levels of the
stagings to the claims, the ropes being
anchored to the ground at both ends: the
upper platforms communicated with the
claims in the centre of the mine, the lower
platforms with those nearer the margin.
The hauling ropes were attached to windlasses
worked by Kafirs on the several
platforms, on which grooved guide wheels
for the ropes were also fixed, the buckets
being swung from the stationary ropes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
by little overhead runners and crooks.
Arrived at the level of the platform the
bucket was tipped into a narrow shoot,
down which the ground ran into a bag held
ready to receive it, in which it was conveyed
away to be sorted. The din and
rattle of these thousands of wheels and the
twang of the buckets along the ropes were
something deafening, while the mine itself
seemed almost darkened by the thick
cobweb of ropes, so numerous as to appear
almost touching. This mode of haulage
continued in vogue during the whole of
1873, and if the appearance of the mine was
less picturesque than when the roadways
existed, it was, if anything, more unique.
By moonlight, particularly, it was a weird
and beautiful sight.”</p>

<p>The mine was now threatened in two
other quarters. The removal of the blue
ground took away the support from the
walls of the pipe, and frequent falls of reef
occurred, not only covering up valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
claims with rubbish, but endangering the
lives of workers below. Moreover, as the
workings deepened, water made its appearance,
necessitating pumping. In 1878 one
quarter of the claims were covered by reef,
and in 1879 over £300,000 were spent on
removing reef and water. In 1881 over
£200,000 were thus spent, and in 1882
more than half a million sterling was
needed to defray the cost of reef removal.
So matters went on until four million cubic
yards of reef had been removed, at a cost
of two millions sterling, and still little good
was done, for out of 400 claims in the mine
only about fifty could be regularly worked.
Ultimately, in November, 1883, the biggest
fall of reef on record took place, estimated
at 250,000 cubic yards, surging half across
the mine, where the bulk of it lies to this
day. It became evident that open workings
could not be carried on at such depths,
and after many experiments the present
system of underground working was devised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time of perplexity, individual
miners who could easily have worked one
or two claims near the surface could not
continue work in the face of harassing
difficulties and heavy expenses. Thus the
claims gradually changed hands until the
mine became the property first of a comparatively
small number of capitalists,
then of a smaller number of limited liability
companies, until finally the whole of the
mines have practically become the property
of the “De Beers Consolidated Mines,
Limited.”</p>

<span class="fs80 bold">KIMBERLEY MINES AT THE PRESENT DAY</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The De Beers Consolidated Mines,
Limited, was founded in 1888, mainly
through the genius of the late Cecil John
Rhodes, for the purpose of acquiring all-important
diamond-mining interests in the
Kimberley area and thereby controlling
the output. The two richest mines, Kimberley
and De Beers, have been actively
worked ever since, and have been the main
contributors to an output which now
realises over five millions sterling annually.
Dutoitspan Mine was completely closed
down, and practically the whole of Bultfontein
was kept idle for many years; but
with a view to the requirements of the
future and the marked increase in the
demand for diamonds, notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
steady rise in prices that has taken place,
both these mines have now been equipped
for underground working on a grand scale.
The youngest of the De Beers group of mines
is the Wesselton, which was discovered in
1890 by the late Mr. H. A. Ward, and soon
afterwards purchased by Mr. Rhodes on
behalf of the Company. The mine is now
being worked opencast on a magnificent
scale and has largely exceeded original
expectations (<a href="#P_034">Fig. 5</a>). The success of the
consolidation is proved by the fact that
since it was brought about £22,000,000 have
been paid in dividends to the shareholders,
and it is roughly estimated that 40,000,000
carats of diamonds have been produced of
a total value of eighty millions.</p>

<p>At the four mines about 8000 persons are
daily employed, namely, 1500 whites and
6500 blacks. The wages are, whites, £5 or
£6 a week; blacks, underground, 4s. to 5s.
a day, and aboveground, 21s. a week.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Compound System</span></h3>

<p>With gems like diamonds, where so large
an intrinsic value is concentrated into so
small a bulk, it is not surprising that
robbery has to be guarded against in the
most elaborate manner. The Illicit Diamond
Buying (I.D.B.) laws are very stringent,
and the searching, rendered easy by the
“compounding” of the natives&mdash;which I
shall describe presently&mdash;is of the most
drastic character (<a href="#P_040">Fig. 6</a>). It is, in fact, very
difficult for a native employee to steal
diamonds; even were he to succeed, it
would be almost impossible to dispose of
them, as a potential buyer would prefer to
secure the safe reward for detecting a theft
rather than run the serious risk of doing
convict work on the Cape Town Breakwater
for a couple of years. I heard of a native
who, secreting a diamond worth several
hundreds of pounds, after trying unsuccessfully
to sell it, handed it back to the manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of his compound, glad to get the sixpence a
carat to which he was entitled. Before the
passing of the “Diamond Trade Act” the
value of diamonds stolen reached nearly
one million sterling per annum.</p>

<p>A “compound” is a large enclosure
about 20 acres in extent, surrounded by
rows of one-story buildings of corrugated
iron. These are divided into rooms holding
each about twenty natives. A high iron
fence is erected around the compound, 10
feet from the buildings. Within the enclosure
is a store where the necessaries of life
are supplied to the natives at a reduced
price, wood and water being provided free
of charge. In the middle is a large swimming-bath,
with fresh water running through
it. The rest of the space is devoted to
recreation, games, dances, concerts, and
any other amusement the native mind can
desire. I have to thank the superintendents
of the respective compounds, who spoke
all the native dialects, for their kindness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
showing us round, and suggesting dances
and concerts, got up at ten minutes’ notice,
for the benefit of my camera. The dancing
was more of the character of attitudinising
and marching to a monotonous tum-tum,
the “orchestra” consisting of various-sized
drums and what they call a piano&mdash;an
octave or so of tuned slabs of wood held
in order on stretched strings and struck
with a wooden hammer. The native music
as a rule is only marking time, but I have
heard musical melodies accompanying some
of their songs. In case of accident or illness
there is a well-appointed hospital where
the sick are tended. Medical supervision,
nurses, and food are supplied free by the
Company.</p>

<p>In the compound are to be seen representatives
of nearly all the picked types of African
tribes. Each tribe keeps to itself, and to
go round the buildings skirting the compound
is an admirable object-lesson in
ethnology. At one point is a group of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Zulus; next we come to Fingoes; then
Basutos; beyond come Matabele, Bechuanas,
Pondos, Shangains, Swazis, and other
less-known tribes, either grouped or wandering
around making friendly calls.</p>

<p>The clothing in the compound is diverse
and original. Some of the men are evident
dandies, whilst others think that in so hot
a climate a bright-coloured handkerchief
or “a pair of spectacles and a smile” is as
great a compliance with the conventions of
civilisation as can be expected.</p>

<p>The natives are not interfered with in
their various amusements, always provided
they do not make themselves objectionable
to their neighbours. They soon learn that
tribal animosities are to be left outside the
compound. One Sunday afternoon my
wife and I walked unattended about the
compound, almost the only whites present
among 1700 natives. The manners of the
fold were so friendly, and their smiles so
cordial, that the idea of fear vanished. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
one part a Kafir was making a pair of
trousers with a bright nickel-plated sewing-machine,
in which he had invested his
savings; next to him a “boy” was reading
from the Testament in his own language
to an attentive audience; in a corner a
party were engaged in cooking a savoury
mess in an iron pot; further on the orchestra
was tuning up and Zulus were putting
the finishing touches to their toilet of
feathers and beads. One group was intently
watching a mysterious game. It is played
by two sides, with stones and grooves and
hollows in the ground, and appears of most
absorbing interest. It seems to be universal
throughout Africa; it is met with among
the ruins of Zimbabwe, and signs of it are
recorded on old Egyptian monuments. I
wanted to learn it, and an intelligent Zulu
player offered to teach it to me in a few
minutes. Captain Dallas, however, with a
more accurate opinion of my intelligence
than my friend the Zulu, assured me it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
would take months before I could begin to
know anything about it. He had tried for
years and could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>They get good wages, varying according
to occupation. The work is appreciated,
and there are always more applicants than
can be accepted. On entering, the restrictions
to which they must submit are fully
explained, and they are required to sign for
three months at least, during which time
they must not leave the compound or mine.
A covered way and tunnel lead the workers
underground to the down shaft, while those
working on the depositing floors go and
come under guard. It is seldom that a man
does not return once he has lived the life
in the compound; some come again and
again for years, only leaving occasionally
to spend accumulated savings. The most
careful men save money, and carry it at
intervals to the superintendent to keep for
them. Occasionally they ask to look at
their savings, which may amount to £30 or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
£40, accumulated by driblets. They are
ignorant of savings banks or interest, and
are content if they see their own money
in the original rags and papers. The Kafir,
on demand, must behold his coins just as he
handed them in, wrappings and all. Sometimes
the superintendent will have as much
as £1000 of savings in his care.</p>

<p>On leaving, the men generally draw all
their savings, and it is not uncommon for
a grateful Kafir to press £2 or £3 on Captain
Dallas in recognition of his trouble. They
are astonished when their offerings are
declined; still more so when it is explained
that if they would put their savings in a
bank they would have a few extra pounds
given to them for the privilege of taking
care of it.</p>

<p>A shrewd young Pondo, who had been
coming year after year, applied for some
of his savings, and gave as a reason that he
wanted to buy a wife. “But you said the
same thing last year,” replied Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Dallas; “I hope nothing has happened.”
“No,” said the man; “one wife, she
quarrel with me; two wives, they quarrel
with each other; me peace!”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Underground Workings</span></h3>

<p>In the face of constant developments I
can only describe the system in use at the
time of my own visits in 1896 and 1905.
Shafts are sunk in the solid rock at a sufficient
distance from the pipe to be safe
against reef movements in the open mine.
In 1903 the rock shafts in the De Beers and
Kimberley Mines reached depths of 2076
and 2599 feet respectively. Tunnels are
driven from these shafts at different levels,
about 120 feet apart, to cross the mine from
west to east. These tunnels are connected
by two other tunnels running north and
south, one near the west side of the mine
and one midway between it and the east
margin of the mine. From the east and
west tunnels offsets are driven to the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
rock. When near the rock the
offsets widen into galleries, these in turn
being stoped on the sides until they meet,
and upwards until they break through the
blue ground. The fallen reef with which
the upper part of the mine is filled sinks
and partially fills the open space. The
workmen then stand on the fallen reef
and drill the blue ground overhead, and as
the roof is blasted back the debris follows.
When stoping between two tunnels the blue is
stoped up to the debris about midway between
the two tunnels. The upper levels
are worked back in advance of the lower
levels, and the works assume the shape of
irregular terraces. The main levels are
from 90 to 120 feet apart, with intermediate
levels every 30 feet. Hoisting is done from
only one level at a time through the same
shaft. By this ingenious method every
portion of blue ground is excavated and
raised to the surface, the rubbish on the
top gradually sinking and taking its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene below ground in the labyrinth
of galleries is bewildering in its complexity,
and very unlike the popular notion of a
diamond mine (<a href="#P_040x">Fig. 7</a>). All below is dirt, mud,
grime; half-naked men, dark as mahogany,
lithe as athletes, dripping with perspiration,
are seen in every direction, hammering,
picking, shovelling, wheeling the trucks to
and fro, keeping up a weird chant which
rises in force and rhythm when a greater
task calls for excessive muscular strain.
The whole scene is more suggestive of a
coal mine than a diamond mine, and all this
mighty organisation, this strenuous expenditure
of energy, this costly machinery,
this ceaseless toil of skilled and black labour,
goes on day and night, just to win a few
stones wherewith to deck my lady’s finger!
All to gratify the vanity of woman! “And,”
interposed a lady who heard this remark,
“the depravity of man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Depositing Floors</span></h3>

<p>Owing to the refractory character of blue
ground fresh from the mines, it has to be
exposed to atmospheric influences before it
will pulverise under the action of water and
mechanical treatment.</p>

<p>From the surface-boxes, into which the
blue ground is tipped when it reaches the
top of the main shaft, it is transferred to
side-tipping trucks and sent to the depositing
floors by means of endless wire-rope
haulage. The speed of the haulage varies
from 2½ to 4 miles per hour. The trucks
are counted automatically as they are sent
to the floor by a reciprocating engine-counter
placed on a frame near the tramline.</p>

<p>The depositing floors are prepared by
removing the bush and grass from a fairly
level piece of ground; this ground is then
rolled smooth and hard. The floors extend
over many square miles of country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
are surrounded by 7-foot barbed wire
fences, vigilantly guarded day and night.
The De Beers floors, on Kenilworth, are laid
off in rectangular sections 600 yards long
and 200 yards wide, each section holding
about 50,000 loads. The ground from the
Kimberley Mine is the softest and only
needs a few months’ exposure on the floors;
the ground from De Beers is much harder
and requires at least six months’ exposure,
while some ground is so hard that it will not
disintegrate by exposure to the weather
under one or two years. The De Beers
Mine contains a much larger quantity of
this hard blue ground than the other mines,
and in order to save the loss of time consequent
on keeping an enormous stock of blue
constantly on the floors, it has recently been
decided to pass the harder and more refractory
stuff direct from the mine through
crushing mills.</p>

<p>For a time the blue ground remains on
the floors without undergoing much alteration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
But soon the heat of the sun and
moisture produce a wonderful effect. Large
pieces, hard as ordinary sandstone when
taken from the mine, commence to crumble.
At this stage the winning of the diamonds
assumes more the nature of farming than
mining. The ground is frequently harrowed
and occasionally watered, to assist
pulverisation by exposing the larger pieces
to atmospheric influences. The length of
time necessary for the ground to weather
before it becomes sufficiently pulverised
for washing depends on the season of the
year and the amount of rain. The longer
the ground remains exposed the better it is
for washing.</p>

FIG. 8. DE BEERS WASHING AND CONCENTRATING MACHINERY.<br />
<p class="right">To face p. 48.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is curious to note that there is a
marked difference in the rapidity of disintegration
of the blue ground in each of
the four mines. The longer the exposure,
the more complete the pulverisation and the
better for washing. Under normal conditions
soft blue ground becomes sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pulverised in from four to six months, but
it is better to expose it for a longer period,
even for a whole year.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Washing and Concentrating Machinery</span></h3>

<p>After the blue ground has been weathered
for a sufficient time, it is again loaded into
trucks and hauled to the crushing machinery
(<a href="#P_048">Fig. 8</a>). The first or “comet” crushers
reduce the ground so that it will pass into
hoppers and thence into revolving cylinders
covered with perforated steel plates, having
holes 1¼ inches in diameter which separate
the finely crushed from the coarse pieces.</p>

<p>Pieces larger than 1¼ inches pass out of
the end of the cylinders and fall upon a
conveyor belt, which takes them to the end
of the machine&mdash;these pieces are mostly
waste rock which is found in the blue ground.</p>

<p>The fine ground which passes through the
holes in the cylinder, together with a
plentiful current of water, flows into the
washing pans. These pans are of iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
14 feet in diameter, furnished with ten
arms each having six or seven teeth. The
teeth are so set as to form a spiral, so that
when the arms revolve the teeth carry the
heavy deposit to the outer rim of the pan,
while the lighter material passes towards
the centre and is carried from the pan by
the flow of water. The heavy deposit
contains the diamonds. It remains on the
bottom of the pan and near its outer rim.
This deposit is drawn off every twelve
hours by means of a broad slot in the
bottom of the pan. The average quantity
of blue ground passed through each pan is
from 400 to 450 loads in ten hours. The
deposit left in each pan after putting the
above number of loads through amounts to
three or four loads, which go to the pulsator
for further concentration.</p>

<p>About 14 per cent of all the ground sent
to the depositing floors is too hard to
weather, so of late years crushing and concentrating
plant has been erected to deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
effectually with the hard lumps, thus saving
the great lock-up of capital consequent on
letting them lie on the floor a year or two.</p>

<p>The hard lumps being hauled to the upper
part of the machine, are tipped into bins,
whence they pass to crushing rollers which so
reduce them that they will pass through a
ring two inches in diameter. The coarse
powder is screened through revolving cylinders
having ½-inch and 1¼-inch perforations.
The stuff passing through the finer
holes goes to the finishing mill, while the
coarser stuff goes to smaller crushers.
Before the coarse lumps are re-crushed they
pass over revolving picking tables, where
any specially large diamonds are rescued,
thus preventing the risk of breakage.
From the picking tables the ground is
scraped automatically into two sets of
rolls, and the pulverised product screened
again and graded into three sizes. The
finest size, passing a ½-inch screen, goes to
the washing pans, and the two coarser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sizes to jigs. Large diamonds which have
been separated from their envelope of blue
are retained in the jig. The ground still
holding the smaller diamonds passes out of
the end of the jig and then through a series
of rolls, screens, and jigs until the diamantiferous
gravel is drawn from the
bottom jigs into locked trucks running on
tramways to the pulsator for further concentration
and sorting.</p>

<p>The pulsator is an ingeniously designed
but somewhat complicated machine for
dealing with the diamantiferous gravel
already reduced one hundred times from
the blue ground, the pulsator still further
concentrating it till the gravel is rich enough
to enable the stones to be picked out by
hand. The value of the diamonds in a load
of original blue ground being about 30s.,
the gravel sent to the pulsator from the
pans, reduced a hundredfold, is worth
£150 a load. Stuff of this value must not be
exposed to risk of peculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The locked trucks are hoisted by a cage
to a platform, where they are unlocked
and their contents fed into a shoot leading
to a cylinder covered with steel sieving with
holes from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> to ⅝ of an inch in diameter.
The five sizes which pass through the
cylinder flow upon a combination of jigs,
termed at the mines the pulsators. The
bottoms of the jigs are covered with screens,
or sieving, the meshes of which are a little
larger than the holes in the revolving
cylinder immediately at the back of them.</p>

<p>Over each screen is spread a layer of
bullets to prevent the rich deposit from
passing too rapidly through the screens.
The jigs themselves are stationary, but
from below an intermittent stream of water
passes in rapid pulsations with an up and
down movement. This pulsation keeps
the diamantiferous gravel constantly moving&mdash;“alive”
is the expressive word used&mdash;and
tends to sort out the constituents
roughly according to their specific gravity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the heavier particles working to the bottom
and the lighter material washing off by the
flow of water and passing into trucks,
whence it is carried to the tailings heap.
The heavier portions, by the up and down
wash of the water, gradually work their
way under the bullets and pass through the
screens into pointed boxes, whence the
heavy concentrates are drawn off upon
endless belts. These convey their precious
load to small elevators by means of which
the concentrates are lifted into hoppers
from which they are fed upon shaking
tables.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs80 bold">COLLECTING THE GEMS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The sorting room in the pulsator house is
long, narrow, and well lighted (<a href="#P_054">Fig. 9</a>).
Here the rich gravel is brought in wet, a
sieveful at a time, and is dumped in a
heap on tables covered with iron plates.
The tables at one end take the coarsest
lumps, next comes the gravel which passed
the ⅜-inch holes, then the next in order,
and so on. The first sorting is done by
thoroughly trustworthy white men; for
here the danger of robbery is greatest.
Sweeping the heap of gravel to the right,
the sorter scrapes a little of it to the centre
of the table by means of a flat piece of
sheet zinc. With this tool he rapidly
passes in review the grains, seizes the diamonds
and puts them into a little tin box
in front of him. The stuff is then swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
off to the left and another lot taken, and
so on till the sieveful of gravel is exhausted,
when another is brought in. The stuff the
sorter has passed to his left as temporarily
inspected is taken next to another part of
the room, where it is again scrutinised by
native convicts again and again, and whilst
diamonds can be found in quantity sufficient
to repay the cost of convict labour, it is
passed under examination.</p>

<p>The diamond has a peculiar lustre, and
on the sorter’s table it is impossible to
mistake it for any other stone that may be
present. It looks somewhat like clear
pieces of gum arabic, with a sort of intrinsic
lustre which makes a conspicuous shine
among the other stones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Automatic Diamond Collector</span></h3>

<p>A series of experiments was initiated by
Mr. Gardner Williams with the object of
separating the diamonds from the heavy,
valueless concentrates with which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
associated. An ordinary shaking or percussion
table was constructed, and every
known means of separation was tried
without success. One of the employees of
De Beers, Mr. Fred Kirsten, was in charge
of the experimenting, under the supervision
of the late Mr. George Labram, the manager
of the large crushing plant, and afterwards
mechanical engineer to the Company. Notwithstanding
the fact that the specific
gravity of the diamond (3·52) was less than
that of several of the minerals associated
with it, so that its separation would seem a
simple matter, it was found in practice to
be impossible owing to the slippery nature
of the diamond. The heavy concentrates
carried diamonds, and diamonds flowed
away from the percussion table with the
tailings. When it seemed that every resource
to do away with hand-sorting had
been exhausted, Kirsten asked to be allowed
to try to catch the diamonds by placing a
coat of thick grease on the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
percussion table with which the other
experiments had been made. Kirsten had
noticed that oily substances, such as axle
grease and white or red lead, adhered to
diamonds when they chanced to come into
contact, and, he argued to himself, if these
substances adhered to diamonds and not
to the other minerals in the concentrates,
why should not diamonds adhere to grease
on the table and the other minerals flow
away? In this way the remarkable discovery
was made that diamonds alone of all
minerals contained in the blue ground will
adhere to grease, and that all others will
flow away as tailings over the end of the
percussion table with the water. After this
was determined by thorough experiments,
more suitable shaking tables were constructed
at the Company’s workshops.
These were from time to time improved
upon, until now all the sorting (except for
the very coarse size) is done by these
machines, whose power of distinction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
far superior to the keenest eye of the
native.</p>

<p>Only about ⅓ of 1 per cent of diamonds
is lost by the first table, and these are
recovered almost to a stone when the concentrates
are passed over the second table.
The discrimination of this sorter is truly
marvellous. Native workers, although experienced
in the handling of diamonds,
often pick out small crystals of zircon, or
Dutch boart, by mistake, but the senseless
machine is practically unerring.</p>

<p>The grease containing the diamonds,
together with a small percentage of very
heavy minerals, such as iron pyrites and
barytes, is scraped from the tables, placed
in buckets made of steel plates with fine
perforations, and boiled or steamed. The
grease passes away to tanks of water, where
it is cooled and is again fit for use. The
diamonds, together with small bits of iron
pyrites, brass nails from the miners’ boots,
pieces of copper from the detonator used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
blasting, which remain on the tables owing
to their high specific gravity, and a very
small admixture of worthless deposit which
has become mechanically mixed with the
grease, are then boiled in a solution containing
caustic soda, where they are freed from
all grease. The quantity of deposit from
the size of ⅝ of an inch downwards, which
now reaches the sorting table, does not
exceed 1 cubic foot for every 12,000 loads
(192,000 cubic feet) of blue ground washed.
As already stated, <sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub> of 1 per cent of the
whole mass of blue formerly passed to the
sorting tables; or, from 12,000 loads, which
is about the daily average of the quantity
washed at De Beers and Kimberley Mines,
800 cubic feet had to be assorted by hand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Yield of Diamonds</span></h3>

<p>Sometimes as many as 8000 carats of
diamonds come from the pulsator in one
day, representing about £20,000 in value.</p>

<p>When the bare statement is made that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
nearly 5,000,000 truck-loads, or more
than 4,000,000 tons of blue ground, have
been washed in a year, the mind only
faintly conceives the prodigious size of the
mass that is annually drawn from the old
craters and laboriously washed and sorted
for the sake of a few bucketfuls of diamonds.
It would form a cube of more than 430 feet,
or a block larger than any cathedral in the
world, and overtopping the spire of St.
Paul’s, while a box with sides measuring
2 feet 9 inches would hold the gems. From
two to three million carats of diamonds are
turned out of the De Beers mines in a year,
and as 5,000,000 carats go to the ton,
this represents half a ton of diamonds. To
the end of 1892 10 tons of diamonds had
come from this mine, valued at £60,000,000
sterling. This mass of blazing diamonds
could be accommodated in a box 5 feet
square and 6 feet high.</p>

<p>The diamond is a luxury, and there is only a
limited demand for it throughout the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
From four to four and a half millions sterling
is as much as is spent annually in diamonds;
if the production is not regulated by the
demand, there will be over-production,
and the trade will suffer. By regulating
the output the directors have succeeded in
maintaining prices since the consolidation
in 1888.</p>

<p>The blue ground varies in its yield of
diamonds in different mines, but is pretty
constant in the same mine. In 1890 the
yield per load of blue ground was:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Varieties of Diamonds</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Fancy Stones</span></h3>

<p>Diamonds occur in all shades, from deep
yellow to pure white and jet black, from
deep brown to light cinnamon, also green,
blue, pink, yellow, orange, and opaque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Both in Kimberley and De Beers the
blue ground on the west side is poorer in
diamonds than the blue ground in other
parts of the mines. The diamonds from the
west side also differ somewhat from those
in other parts of the same mine.</p>

<p>The diamonds from each mine have a
distinctive character, and so uniform are
the characteristics that an experienced
buyer can tell at once the locality of any
particular parcel of stones. An isolated
stone may, of course, be found occasionally
in any one mine which is characteristic of
some other source of production, but this
is the exception to the general rule.</p>

<p>There is a great similarity between the
produce of the De Beers and Kimberley
mines. A day’s wash from either of these
mines could be distinguished from each
other, but not so easily the majority of the
individual stones.</p>

<p>The Kimberley Mine produces a small
percentage of white crystals, octahedral in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
shape, is noted for its large macles, and,
in common with the De Beers Mine, it also
yields a large percentage of coloured and
large yellow diamonds.</p>

<p>The De Beers Mine produces a comparatively
small percentage of really white
diamonds, but is noted for its fine silvery
capes.</p>

<p>The Dutoitspan Mine is noted for its fine
white cleavages, silver capes, large yellows,
and an exceptional proportion of large
stones generally. It also produces a small
proportion of fine white, octahedral-shaped
crystals and a comparatively small proportion
of diamonds below 0·2 of a carat in size.</p>

<p>The Bultfontein Mine produces a very
large percentage of white diamonds, mostly
octahedral in shape and generally small in
size. It produces very few coloured stones,
but a larger percentage of flawed and spotted
stones than any other mine. Even the
apparently pure stones from this mine frequently
develop flaws in cutting, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the rough were imperceptible to the naked
eye.</p>

<p>The Wesselton Mine diamonds are noted
for an abnormally large percentage of
octahedral stones, a large proportion of
which are free from flaws. White and
brown stones predominate in this mine;
there is almost an entire absence of the
ordinary yellow, but very fine golden-coloured
fancy stones are unearthed occasionally,
invariably in the form of cleavage,
and hardly ever exceeding 2 carats each in
weight.</p>

<p>For “golden fancies” this mine is unrivalled.
Wesselton diamonds are easily
distinguished from the produce of every
other mine by a decided gloss common to
them.</p>

<p>Wesselton produces more stones of 10
carats each and over than Bultfontein, but
comparatively few large stones of over
50 carats each. It produces a very large
percentage of small diamonds under 0·2 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a carat. With Bultfontein it shares the
distinction of yielding cubical stones occasionally.
It also produces a small percentage
of blue-whites.</p>

<p>The Frank Smith Mine produces very
fine white diamonds, fairly regular in shape,
mostly octahedral, and hardly any coloured
stones. Many of the stones are grooved at
the edges.</p>

<p>The Kamfersdam Mine yields diamonds
of very inferior quality, dark brown being
the predominating colour, and even the
majority of the better-class stones from this
mine are faintly tinged with brown.</p>

<p>The Kimberley West, formerly known as
Theron’s Mine, situated about 30 miles due
west of Kimberley, yields a very small
percentage of blue-whites, fine “silver capes,”
and a large proportion of brown diamonds,
somewhat better in quality than Kamfersdam
and more regular in shape. The
diamonds from this mine present a distinctly
“alluvial” appearance, but they are nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
distinctive in character from river
diamonds and much inferior in quality.</p>

<p>The diamonds from the Leicester Mine
are of a distinctive character; they are very
much grooved, extremely bad shapes for
cutting, and many of the stones are cross-grained.</p>

<p>The Newlands Mine, West Griqualand,
about 40 miles north-west of Kimberley, is
interesting on account of the occurrence of
diamond in what the Reverend Professor
Bonney considers to be its true matrix.
The workmen occasionally come across well-rounded,
boulder-like masses of eclogite, a
rather coarsely crystalline rock, sometimes
more than a foot in diameter. Some of
these boulders have diamonds imbedded in
them. One piece examined by Professor
Bonney measured approximately 4 inches
by 3 inches by 2 inches, and appeared to
have been broken off a larger eclogite
boulder. In it were seen ten diamonds,
mostly well-crystallised octahedra, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
colourless, with brilliant lustre, four of them
being comprised within a space of a quarter
of an inch square. All these diamonds were
on the surface. Probably others would have
been found inside, but it was not considered
desirable to destroy the specimen by breaking
it up. It is now in the Natural History
Museum, having been presented by the
Directors of the Newlands Mine.</p>

<p>Eclogite has been found in other diamond
mines, but I am not aware that
diamonds have been found imbedded in it
except in the Newlands Mine.</p>

<p>Stones from Jagersfontein, in the Orange
River Colony, display great purity of colour
and brilliancy, and they have the so-called
“steely” lustre characteristic of old Indian
gems.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Falling off of Yield with Depth</span></h3>

<p>According to tables furnished by the
De Beers Company, the yield of the De
Beers and Kimberley mines has declined as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the depth increases. At the same time the
value of the stones has risen, and diamonds
are more expensive to-day than at any
previous time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stones other than Diamonds</span></h3>

<p>Accompanying diamonds in the concentrates
are a number of other minerals of
high specific gravity, and some of notable
beauty. Among these are the rich red
pyrope (garnet), sp. gr. 3·7, containing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
1·4 to 3 per cent of oxide of chromium;
zircon, in flesh-coloured grains and crystals,
sp. gr. 4 to 4·7; kyanite, sp. gr. 3·45 to 3·7,
discernible by its blue colour and perfect
cleavage; chrome diopside, sp. gr. 3·23 to
3·5, of a bright green colour; bronzite, sp.
gr. 3·1 to 3·3; magnetite, sp. gr. 4·9 to 5·2;
mixed chrome and titanium iron ore, sp. gr.
4·4 to 4·9, containing from 13 to 61 per cent
of oxide of chromium, and from 3 to 68 per
cent of titanic acid, in, changeable quantities;
hornblende, sp. gr. 2·9 to 3·4;
barytes, sp. gr. 4·3 to 4·7; and mica. Some
of the garnets are of fine quality, and one
was recently cut which resembled a pigeonblood
ruby, and attracted an offer of £25.</p>

<p>In the pulsator and sorting house most
of the native labourers are long-sentence
convicts, supplied with food, clothing, and
medical attendance by the Company. They
are necessarily well guarded. I myself saw
about 1000 convicts at work. I was told
that insubordination is very rare; apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from the hopelessness of a successful rising,
there is little inducement to revolt; the lot
of these diamond workers is preferable to
life in the Government prisons, and they
seem contented.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">From the pulsator the diamonds are
sent to the general office in Kimberley
to be cleansed in a boiling mixture of nitric
and sulphuric acids. A parcel of diamonds
loses about half a part per 1000 by this treatment.
On one of my visits to the diamond
office the door opened and in walked two
young men, each carrying a large enamelled
saucepan containing something steaming
hot. They went to one of the zinc-covered
tables and turned out from the saucepans a
lustrous heap of 25,000 carats of diamonds
(<a href="#P_072">Fig. 10</a>). They had just been boiled in
acid and washed.</p>

<p>After purification the diamonds are handed
to the valuators (<a href="#P_072x">Fig. 11</a>), who sort them
into classes, according to size, colour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>

<p>It is a sight for Aladdin to see the valuators
at work in the strong-room of the
De Beers Company at Kimberley. The
tables are literally heaped with stones won
from the rough blue ground&mdash;stones of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sizes, purified, flashing, and of inestimable
price; stones that will be coveted by men
and women all the world over; and last,
but not least, stones that are probably
destined to largely influence the development
and history of a whole huge continent.</p>

<span class="fs80 bold">NOTEWORTHY DIAMONDS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Prodigious diamonds are not so uncommon
as is generally supposed.
Diamonds weighing over an ounce (151·5
carats) are not unfrequent at Kimberley.
Some years ago, in one parcel of stones,
I saw eight perfect ounce crystals, and one
stone weighing 2 ounces (<a href="#P_076">Fig. 12</a>). The largest
diamond from the Kimberley mines weighed
428½ carats, or nearly 4 ounces troy. It
measured 1⅞ inch through the longest axis
and was 1½ inch square. After cutting it
weighed 228½ carats, losing 200 carats in
the process. The largest known diamond
was discovered in January, 1905, at the
New Premier Mine, near Pretoria. This
mine is of the same type as the Kimberley
mines, but larger in size, and, in fact, is the
largest known diamantiferous pipe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
world&mdash;the pipe containing the “blue
ground,” along the longer diameter of its
oval-shaped cross-section, measuring over
half a mile, and its area is estimated at
350,000 square yards. This pipe breaks
through felsitic rocks. The diamond, called
“Cullinan” from the name of one of the
directors of the company on whose farm it
was discovered, was presented to King
Edward on his birthday by the people of
the Transvaal. It weighed no less than
3025¾ carats, or 9586·5 grains (1·37 lb.
avoirdupois). It was a fragment, probably
less than half, of a distorted octahedral
crystal; the other portions still await discovery
by some fortunate miner. The
frontispiece shows this diamond in its
natural size, from a photograph taken by
myself. I had an opportunity of examining
and experimenting with this unequalled
stone before it was cut. A beam of polarised
light passed in any direction through the
stone, and then through an analyser, revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
colours in all cases, appearing brightest
when the light passed along the greatest
diameter&mdash;about 4 inches. Here the colours
were very fine, but no regular figure was to
be seen. Round a small black spot in the
interior of the stone the colours were very
vivid, changing and rotating round the spot
as the analyser was turned. These observations
indicated internal strain.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The clearness throughout was remarkable,
the stone being absolutely limpid like water,
with the exception of a few flaws, dark
graphitic spots, and coloured patches close
to the outside. At one part near the surface
there was an internal crack, showing well
the colours of thin plates. At another
point there was a milky, opaque mass, of a
brown colour, with pieces of what looked
like iron oxide. There were four cleavage
planes of great smoothness and regularity.
On other parts of the surface the crystalline
structure was very marked. The edges
were rounded in parts, and triangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
markings (depressions) were to be seen.
I also noticed square depressions, nearly
as sharp and perfect as the triangular ones.</p>

<p>The cleaving and cutting and polishing of
the Cullinan diamond was entrusted to the
firm of Asscher and Co., in Amsterdam.
The cleavage of the diamond was very
successfully accomplished by Mr. Joseph
Asscher. An incision half an inch deep was
made with a sharp diamond point in the
proper place, then a specially designed
knife blade was placed in the incision and
it was struck a heavy blow with a piece of
steel. The diamond split through a defective
spot, part of which was left in each
portion of the diamond.</p>

<p>Gigantic as is the Cullinan diamond, it
represents in weight less than half the daily
output of the De Beers mines, which averages
about 7000 carats per day.</p>

<p>Next in size to the Cullinan comes the one
which was found at the Jagersfontein Mine.
It weighed 970 carats&mdash;over half a pound.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs80 bold">BOART, CARBONADO, AND GRAPHITE</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The black inclusions in some transparent
diamonds consist of graphite.
On crushing a clear diamond showing such
spots and heating in oxygen to a temperature
well below the point at which diamond
begins to burn, Moissan found that the
grey tint of the powder disappeared, no
black spots being seen under the microscope.
There also occur what may be considered
intermediate forms between the well-crystallised
diamond and graphite. These are
“boart” and “carbonado.” Boart is an
imperfectly crystallised diamond, having
no clear portions, and therefore useless for
gems. Shot boart is frequently found in
spherical globules, and may be of all colours.
Ordinary boart is so hard that it is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in rock-drilling, and when crushed it is
employed for cutting and polishing other
stones. Carbonado is the Brazilian term
for a still less perfectly crystallised form of
carbon. It is equally hard, and occurs in
porous masses and in massive black pebbles,
sometimes weighing two or more ounces.</p>

<p>The ash left after burning a diamond
invariably contains iron as its chief constituent;
and the most common colours of
diamonds, when not perfectly pellucid, show
various shades of brown and yellow, from
the palest “off colour” to almost black.
These variations give support to the theory
advanced by Moissan that the diamond has
separated from molten iron&mdash;a theory of
which I shall say more presently&mdash;and also
explain how it happens that stones from
different mines, and even from different
parts of the same mine, differ from each
other. Further confirmation is given by
the fact that the country round Kimberley
is remarkable for its ferruginous character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and iron-saturated soil is popularly regarded
as one of the indications of the near
presence of diamonds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Graphite</span></h3>

<p>Intermediate between soft carbon and
diamond come the graphites. The name
graphite is given to a variety of carbon,
generally crystalline, which in an oxidising
mixture of chlorate of potassium and
nitric acid forms graphitic oxide. This
varies in colour from green to brown or
yellow, or it is almost without colour,
according to the completeness of the reaction.
Graphites are of varying densities,
from 2·0 to 3·0, and generally of crystalline
aspect. Graphite and diamond pass insensibly
into one another. Hard graphite
and soft diamond are near the same specific
gravity. The difference appears to be one
of pressure at the time of formation.</p>

<p>Some forms of graphite exhibit the remarkable
property by which it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to ascertain approximately the temperature
at which they were formed, or to which
they have subsequently been exposed.
Sprouting graphite is a form, frequently met
with in nature, which on moderate heating
swells up to a bulky, very light mass of
amorphous carbon. Moissan has found it
in blue ground from Kimberley; my own
results verify his. When obtained by
simple elevation of temperature in the arc
or the electric furnace graphites do not
sprout; but when they are formed by dissolving
carbon in a metal at a high temperature
and then allowing the graphite to
separate out on cooling, the sprouting
variety appears. The phenomenon of sprouting
is easily shown. If a few grains are
placed in a test-tube and heated to about
170° C., the grains increase enormously in
bulk and fill the tube with a light form of
amorphous carbon.</p>

<p>The resistance of a graphite to oxidising
agents is greater the higher the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to which it has previously been exposed.
Graphites which are easily attacked by a
mixture of fuming nitric acid and potassium
chlorate are rendered more resistant by
strong heat in the electric furnace.</p>

<p>I have already signified that there are
various degrees of refractoriness to chemical
reagents among the different forms of
graphite. Some dissolve in strong nitric acid;
other forms of graphite require a mixture
of highly concentrated nitric acid and
potassium chlorate to attack them, and
even with this intensely powerful agent
some graphites resist longer than others.
M. Moissan has shown that the power of
resistance to nitric acid and potassium
chlorate is in proportion to the temperature
at which the graphite was formed, and with
tolerable certainty we can estimate this
temperature by the resistance of the specimen
of graphite to this reagent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crystallisation</span></h3>

<p>The diamond belongs to the isometric
system of crystallography; the prevailing
form is octahedral. It frequently occurs
with curved faces and edges. Twin crystals
(macles) are not uncommon. Diamond
crystals are generally perfect on all sides.
They seldom show irregular sides or faces
by which they were attached to a support,
as do artificial crystals of chemical salts;
another proof that the diamond must have
crystallised from a dense liquid.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration (<a href="#P_086">Fig. 14</a>)

of native diamonds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some crystals of diamonds have their surfaces
beautifully marked with equilateral
triangles, interlaced and of varying sizes
(<a href="#P_088">Fig. 15</a>). Under the microscope these markings
appear as hollow depressions sharply
cut out of the surrounding surface, and
these depressions were supposed by Gustav
Rose to indicate the probability that the
diamonds had at some previous time been
exposed to incipient combustion. Rose
pointed out that similar triangular striations
appeared on the surfaces of diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
burnt before the blowpipe. This experiment
I have repeated on a clear diamond, and I
have satisfied myself that during combustion
before the blowpipe, in the field of a
microscope, the surface is etched with
triangular markings different in character
from those naturally on crystals (<a href="#P_088x">Fig. 16</a>).
The artificial striæ are very irregular, much
smaller, and massed closer together, looking
as if the diamond during combustion flaked
away in triangular chips, while the markings
natural to crystals appear as if produced by
the crystallising force as they were being
built up. Many crystals of chemical compounds
appear striated from both these
causes. Geometrical markings can be produced
by eroding the surface of a crystal
of alum with water, and they also occur
naturally during crystallisation.</p>

<span class="fs80 bold">PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
OF THE DIAMOND</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">I need scarcely say the diamond is
almost pure carbon, and it is the hardest
substance in nature.</p>

<p>When heated in air or oxygen to a temperature
varying from 760° to 875° C.,
according to its hardness, the diamond
burns with production of carbonic acid.
It leaves an extremely light ash, sometimes
retaining the shape of the crystal, consisting
of iron, lime, magnesia, silica, and titanium.
In boart and carbonado the amount of ash
sometimes rises to 4 per cent, but in clear
crystallised diamonds it is seldom higher
than 0·05 per cent. By far the largest
constituent of the ash is iron.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hardness</span></h3>

<p>Diamonds vary considerably in hardness,
and even different parts of the same crystal
differ in their resistance to cutting and
grinding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Beautifully white diamonds have been
found at Inverel, New South Wales, and
from the rich yield of the mine and the
white colour of the stones great things were
expected. In the first parcel which came to
England the stones were found to be so
much harder than South African diamonds
that it was at first feared they would be
useless except for rock-boring purposes.
The difficulty of cutting them disappeared
with improved appliances, and they now are
highly prized.</p>

<p>The famous Koh-i-noor, when being cut
into its present form, showed a notable
variation in hardness. In cutting one of
the facets near a yellow flaw, the crystal
became harder and harder the further it
was cut, until, after working the mill for six
hours at the usual speed of 2400 revolutions
a minute, little impression was made. The
speed was increased to more than 3000,
when the work slowly proceeded. Other
portions of the stone were found to be comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
soft, and became harder as the
outside was cut away.</p>

<p>The intense hardness of the diamond can
be illustrated by the following experiment.
On the flattened apex of a conical block of
steel place a diamond, and upon it bring down
a second cone of steel. On forcing together
the two steel cones by hydraulic pressure
the stone is squeezed into the steel blocks
without injuring it in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>In an experiment I made at Kimberley
the pressure gauge showed 60 atmospheres,
and the piston being 3·2 inches diameter,
the absolute pressure was 3·16 tons, equivalent
on a diamond of 12 square mm. surface
to 170 tons per square inch of diamond.</p>

<p>The use of diamond in glass-cutting I
need not dwell on. So hard is diamond in
comparison to glass, that a suitable splinter
of diamond will plane curls off a glass plate
as a carpenter’s tool will plane shavings off
a deal board. The illustration (<a href="#P_098">Fig. 17</a>)
shows a few diamond-cut glass shavings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Density or Specific Gravity</span></h3>

<p>The specific gravity of the diamond varies
ordinarily from 3·514 to 3·518. For comparison,
I give in tabular form the specific
gravities of the different varieties of carbon
and of the minerals found on the sorting
tables:</p>

<p>There is a substance, the double nitrate
of silver and thallium, which, while solid
at ordinary temperatures, liquefies at 75° C.
and then has a specific gravity of 4·5. Admixture
with water lowers the density to
any desired point.</p>

<p>If a glass cell is taken containing this
liquid diluted to a density of about 3·6, and
in it is thrown pieces of the above-named
minerals, all those whose density is lower
than 3·6 will rise to the surface, while the
denser minerals will sink. If now a little water
is carefully added with constantly stirring
until the density of the liquid is reduced
to that of the diamond, the heterogeneous
collection sorts itself into three parts. The
graphite, quartz, beryl, mica, and hornblende
rise to the surface; the garnet,
corundum, zircons, etc., sink to the bottom,
while the diamonds float in the middle of
the liquid. With a platinum landing-net I
can skim off the swimmers and put them into
one dish; with the same net I can fish out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the diamonds and put them in a second dish,
while by raising a sieve at the bottom I can
remove the heavy minerals and put them
into a third. The accurate separation of
diamonds from the heterogeneous mixture
can be effected in less time than is taken to
describe the experiment.</p>

<p>The table shows that diamonds vary somewhat
in density among themselves, between
narrow limits. Occasionally, however, diamonds
overpass these figures. Here is an
illustration. In a test-tube of the same
dense liquid are three selected diamonds.
One rises to the top, another floats uncertain
where to settle, rising and falling as the
temperature of the sorting liquid is raised
or lowered, whilst the third sinks to the
bottom. Allowing the liquid to cool a
degree or two slightly increases the density

<h3><span class="smcap">Phosphorescence of Diamond</span></h3>

<p>After exposure for some time to the sun
many diamonds glow in a dark room.
Some diamonds are fluorescent, appearing
milky in sunlight. In a vacuum, exposed
to a high-tension current of electricity,
diamonds phosphoresce of different colours,
most South African diamonds shining with a
bluish light. Diamonds from other localities
emit bright blue, apricot, pale blue, red,
yellowish green, orange, and pale green
light. The most phosphorescent diamonds
are those which are fluorescent in the sun.
One beautiful green diamond in the writer’s
collection, when phosphorescing in a good
vacuum, gives almost as much light as a
candle, and you can easily read by its rays.
But the time has hardly come when diamonds
can be used as domestic illuminants!
The emitted light is pale green, tending to
white, and in its spectrum, when strong,
can be seen bright lines, one at about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
λ 5370 in the green, one at λ 5130 in the
greenish blue, and one at λ 5030 in the blue.
A beautiful collection of diamond crystals
belonging to Professor Maskelyne phosphoresces
with nearly all the colours of the rainbow,
the different faces glowing with different
shades of colour. Diamonds which phosphoresce
red generally show the yellow
sodium line on a continuous spectrum. In
one Brazilian diamond phosphorescing a
reddish-yellow colour I detected in its spectrum
the citron line characteristic of yttrium.</p>

<p>The rays which make the diamond phosphoresce
are high in the ultra-violet. To
illustrate this phosphorescence under the
influence of the ultra-violet rays, arrange a
powerful source of these rays, and in front
expose a design made up of certain minerals,
willemite, franklinite, calcite, etc.&mdash;phosphorescing
of different colours. Their brilliant
glow ceases entirely when a thin piece
of glass is interposed between them and the
ultra-violet lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>I now draw attention to a strange property
of the diamond, which at first sight
might seem to discount the great permanence
and unalterability of this stone. It has been
ascertained that the cause of phosphorescence
is in some way connected with the
hammering of the electrons, violently driven
from the negative pole on to the surface of
the body under examination, and so great is
the energy of the bombardment, that impinging
on a piece of platinum or even
iridium, the metal will actually melt. When
the diamond is thus bombarded in a radiant
matter tube the result is startling. It not
only phosphoresces, but becomes discoloured,
and in course of time becomes black on the
surface. Some diamonds blacken in the
course of a few minutes, while others require
an hour or more to discolour. This
blackening is only superficial, and although
no ordinary means of cleaning will remove
the discolouration, it goes at once when the
stone is polished with diamond powder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Ordinary oxidising reagents have little or
no effect in restoring the colour.</p>

<p>The superficial dark coating on a diamond
after exposure to molecular bombardment
I have proved to be graphite. M. Moissan
has shown that this graphite, on account of
its great resistance to oxidising reagents,
cannot have been formed at a lower temperature
than 3600° C.</p>

<p>It is thus manifest that the bombarding
electrons, striking the diamond with enormous
velocity, raise the superficial layer to
the temperature of the electric arc and turn
it into graphite, whilst the mass of diamond
and its conductivity to heat are sufficient to
keep down the general temperature to such
a point that the tube appears scarcely more
than warm to the touch.</p>

<p>A similar action occurs with silver, the
superficial layers of which can be raised to
a red heat without the whole mass becoming
more than warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conversion of Diamond into Graphite</span></h3>

<p>Although we cannot convert graphite
into diamond, we can change the diamond
into graphite. A clear crystal of diamond
is placed between two carbon poles, and
the poles with intervening diamond are
brought together and an arc formed between.
The temperature of the diamond rapidly
rises, and when it approaches 3600° C., the
vaporising point of carbon, it breaks down,
swells, and changes into black and valueless
graphite.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tribo-Luminescence</span></h3>

<p>A few minerals give out light when rubbed.
In the year 1663 the Hon. Robert Boyle
read a paper before the Royal Society,
in which he described several experiments
made with a diamond which markedly
showed tribo-luminescence. As specimens
of tribo-luminescent bodies I may instance
sphalerite (sulphide of zinc), and an artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sphalerite, which is even more responsive
to friction than the native sulphide.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Kunz, wife of the well-known New
York mineralogist, possesses, perhaps, the
most remarkable of all phosphorescing
diamonds. This prodigy diamond will
phosphoresce in the dark for some minutes
after being exposed to a small pocket electric
light, and if rubbed on a piece of cloth a long
streak of phosphorescence appears.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Absorption Spectrum of Diamond</span></h3>

<p>On passing a ray of light through a diamond
and examining it in a spectroscope,
Walter has found in all colourless brilliants
of over 1 carat in weight an absorption
band at wave-length 4155 (violet). He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ascribes this band to an impurity and suggests
it may possibly be due to samarium.
Three other fainter lines were detected in
the ultra-violet by means of photography.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Refractivity</span></h3>

<p>But it is not the hardness of the diamond
so much as its optical qualities that make
it so highly prized. It is one of the most
refracting substances in nature, and it also
has the highest reflecting properties. In
the cutting of diamonds advantage is
taken of these qualities. When cut as a
brilliant the facets on the lower side are
inclined so that light falls on them at an
angle of 24° 13´, at which angle all the
incident light is totally reflected. A well-cut
brilliant should appear opaque by
transmitted light except at a small spot in
the middle where the table and culet are
opposite. All the light falling on the front
of the stone is reflected from the facets, and
the light passing into the diamond is reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
from the interior surfaces and refracted
into colours when it passes out into
the air, giving rise to the lightnings, the
effulgence, and coruscations for which the
diamond is supreme above all other gems.</p>

<p>The following table gives the refractive
indices of diamonds and other bodies:</p>

<p>In vain I have searched for a liquid of the
same refraction as diamond. Such a liquid
would be invaluable to the merchant, as on
immersing a stone the clear body would
absolutely disappear, leaving in all their
ugliness the flaws and black specks so frequently
seen even in the best stones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Diamond and Polarised Light</span></h3>

<p>Having no double refraction, the diamond
should not act on polarised light. But as is
well known, if a transparent body which
does not so act is submitted to strain of an
irregular character it becomes doubly refracting,
and in the polariscope reveals the
existence of the strain by brilliant colours
arranged in a more or less defined pattern,
according to the state of tension in which
the crystal exists. I have examined many
hundred diamond crystals under polarised
light, and with few exceptions the colours
show how great is the strain to which some
of them are exposed. On rotating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
polariser, the black cross most frequently
seen revolves round a particular point in
the inside of the crystal; on examining
this point with a high power we sometimes
see a slight flaw, more rarely a minute
cavity. The cavity is filled with gas at
enormous pressure, and the strain is set up
in the stone by the effort of the gas to
escape. I have already said that the great
Cullinan diamond by this means revealed a
state of considerable internal stress and
strain.</p>

<p>So great is this strain of internal tension
that it is not uncommon for a diamond to
explode soon after it reaches the surface,
and some have been known to burst in the
pockets of the miners or when held in the
warm hand. Large crystals are more liable
to burst than smaller pieces. Valuable
stones have been destroyed in this way, and
it is whispered that cunning dealers are not
averse to allowing responsible clients to
handle or carry in their warm pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
large crystals fresh from the mine. By
way of safeguard against explosion some
dealers imbed large diamonds in raw potato
to ensure safe transit to England.</p>

<p>The anomalous action which many diamonds
exert on polarised light is not such as
can be induced by heat, but it can easily be
conferred on diamonds by pressure, showing
that the strain has not been produced by
sudden cooling, but by sudden lowering of
pressure.</p>

<p>The illustration of this peculiarity is not
only difficult, but sometimes exceedingly
costly&mdash;difficult because it is necessary to
arrange for projecting on the screen the
image of a diamond crystal between the
jaws of a hydraulic press, the illuminating
light having to pass through delicate optical
polarising apparatus&mdash;and costly because
only perfectly clear crystals can be used, and
crystals of this character sometimes fly
to pieces as the pressure rises. At first no
colour is seen on the screen, the crystal not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
being birefringent. A movement of the
handle of the press, however, gives the
crystal a pinch, instantly responded to by
the colours on the screen, showing the production
of double refraction. Another
movement of the handle brightens the
colours, and a third may strain the crystal
beyond its power of resistance, when the
crystal flies to pieces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Diamond and Röntgen Rays</span></h3>

<p>The diamond is remarkable in another
respect. It is extremely transparent to the
Röntgen rays, whereas highly refracting
glass, used in imitation diamonds, is almost
perfectly opaque to the rays. I exposed
for a few seconds over a photographic plate
to the X-rays the large Delhi diamond of
a rose-pink colour weighing 31½ carats, a
black diamond weighing 23 carats, and a
glass imitation of the pink diamond (<a href="#P_098x">Fig. 18</a>).
On development the impression where the
diamond obscured the rays was found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
strong, showing that most rays passed
through, while the glass was practically
opaque. By this means imitation diamonds
can readily be distinguished from true gems.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Action of Radium on Diamond</span></h3>

<p>The β-rays from radium having like
properties to the stream of negative electrons
in a radiant matter tube, it was of
interest to ascertain if they would exert a
like difference on diamond. The diamond
glows under the influence of the β-radiations,
and crushed diamond cemented to a piece
of card or metal makes an excellent screen
in a spinthariscope&mdash;almost as good as zinc
sulphide. Some colourless crystals of diamond
were imbedded in radium bromide
and kept undisturbed for more than twelve
months. At the end of that time they were
examined. The radium had caused them
to assume a bluish-green colour, and their
value as “fancy stones” had been increased.</p>

<p>This colour is persistent and penetrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
below the surface. It is unaffected by long-continued
heating in strong nitric acid and
potassium chlorate, and is not discharged
by heating to redness.</p>

<p>To find out if this prolonged contact with
radium had communicated to the diamond
any radio-active properties, six diamonds
were put on a photographic plate and kept
in the dark for a few hours. All showed
radio-activity by darkening the sensitive
plate, some being more-active than others.
Like the green tint, the radio-activity persists
after drastic treatment. To me this proves
that radio-activity does not merely consist
in the adhesion of electrons or emanations
given off by radium to the surface of an
adjacent body, but the property is one
involving layers below the surface, and like
the alteration of tint, is probably closely
connected with the intense molecular excitement
the stone had experienced during its
twelve months’ burial in radium bromide.</p>

<p>A diamond that had been coloured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
radium, and had acquired strong radio-active
properties, was slowly heated to dull
redness in a dark room. Just before visibility
a faint phosphorescence spread over the
stone. On cooling and examining the diamond
it was found that neither the colour nor the
radio-activity had suffered appreciably.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiling- and Melting-point of Carbon</span></h3>

<p>On the average the critical point of a
substance is 1·5 times its absolute boiling-point.
Therefore the critical point of carbon
should be about 5800° Ab. But the absolute
critical temperature divided by the critical
pressure is for all the elements so far examined
never less than 2·5; this being
about the value Sir James Dewar finds for
hydrogen. So that, accepting this, we get
the maximum critical pressure as follows,
viz. 2320 atmospheres:</p>

<p class="pad3">
<span class="blkb">
    <span class="blka u">5800° Ab.</span>
    <span class="blka">CrP</span>
</span> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 2.5, &nbsp; or CrP &nbsp; = &nbsp; <span class="blkb">
                        <span class="blka u">5800° Ab.</span>
                        <span class="blka">2.5</span>
                        </span>,</p>
<p class="center">or 2320 atmospheres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Carbon and arsenic are the only two
elements that have a melting-point above
the boiling-point; and among compounds
carbonic acid and fluoride of silicium are the
only other bodies with similar properties.
Now the melting-point of arsenic is about
1·2 times its absolute boiling-point. With
carbonic acid and fluoride of silicium the
melting-points are about 1·1 times their
boiling-points. Applying these ratios to
carbon, we find that its melting-point would
be about 4400°.</p>

<p>Therefore, assuming the following data:</p>

<div class="center">

Fig. 19. Curve of Vapour Pressure of Carbon
</div>
</div>

<p>If, then, we may reason from these rough
estimates, above a temperature of 5800° Ab.
no amount of pressure will cause carbon
vapour to assume liquid form, whilst at
4400° Ab. a pressure of above 17 atmospheres
would suffice to liquefy some of it.
Between these extremes the curve of vapour
pressure is assumed to be logarithmic, as
represented in the accompanying diagram.
The constant 39120 which occurs in the
logarithmic formula enables us to calculate
the latent heat of evaporation. If we assume
the vapour density to be normal, or the
molecule in vapour as C<sub>2</sub>, then the heat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
volatilisation of 12 grms. of carbon would be
90,000 calories; or, if the vapour is a condensed
molecule like C<sub>6</sub>, then the 12 grms.
would need 30,000 calories. In the latter
case the evaporation of 1 grm. of carbon
would require 2500 calories, whereas a substance
like zinc needs only about 400
calories.</p>

<span class="fs80 bold">GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Speculations as to the probable origin
of the diamond have been greatly forwarded
by patient research, and particularly
by improved means of obtaining high temperatures,
an advance we owe principally to
the researches of the late Professor Moissan.</p>

<p>Until recent years carbon was considered
absolutely non-volatile and infusible; but
the enormous temperatures placed at the disposal
of experimentalists by the introduction
of electricity show that, instead of breaking
rules, carbon obeys the same laws that
govern other bodies. It volatilises at the
ordinary pressure at a temperature of about
3600° C., and passes from the solid to the
gaseous state without liquefying. It has
been found that other bodies, such as arsenic,
which volatilise without liquefying at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
ordinary pressure, will easily liquefy if pressure
is added to temperature. It naturally
follows that if along with the requisite temperature
sufficient pressure is applied, liquefaction
of carbon will take place, when on
cooling it will crystallise. But carbon at
high temperatures is a most energetic
chemical agent, and if it can get hold of
oxygen from the atmosphere or any compound
containing it, it will oxidise and fly
off in the form of carbonic acid. Heat and
pressure therefore are of no avail unless the
carbon can be kept inert.</p>

<p>It has long been known that iron, when
melted, dissolves carbon, and on cooling
liberates it in the form of graphite. Moissan
discovered that several other metals, especially
silver, have similar properties; but
iron is the best solvent for carbon. The
quantity of carbon entering into solution
increases with the temperature.</p>

FIG. 20. MOISSAN’S ELECTRIC FURNACE.<br />
<p class="right">To face p. 116.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the artificial manufacture of diamond
the first necessity is to select pure iron&mdash;free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
from sulphur, silicon, phosphorus, etc.&mdash;and
to pack it in a carbon crucible with pure charcoal
from sugar. The crucible is then put
into the body of the electric furnace and a
powerful arc formed close above it between
carbon poles, utilising a current of 700
ampères at 40 volts pressure (<a href="#P_116">Fig. 20</a>). The
iron rapidly melts and saturates itself with
carbon. After a few minutes’ heating to a
temperature above 4000° C.&mdash;a temperature
at which the iron melts like wax and volatilises
in clouds&mdash;the current is stopped and
the dazzling fiery crucible is plunged beneath
the surface of cold water, where it is
held till it sinks below a red heat. As is well
known, iron increases in volume at the
moment of passing from the liquid to the
solid state. The sudden cooling solidifies
the outer layer of iron and holds the inner
molten mass in a tight grip. The expansion
of the inner liquid on solidifying produces
an enormous pressure, and under the stress
of this pressure the dissolved carbon separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
out in transparent forms&mdash;minutely
microscopic, it is true&mdash;all the same veritable
diamonds, with crystalline form and
appearance, colour, hardness, and action on
light, the same as the natural gem.</p>

<p>Now commences the tedious part of the
process. The metallic ingot is attacked with
hot nitro-hydrochloric acid until no more
iron is dissolved. The bulky residue consists
chiefly of graphite, together with
translucent chestnut-coloured flakes of carbon,
black opaque carbon of a density of
from 3·0 to 3·5 and hard as diamonds&mdash;black
diamonds or carbonado, in fact&mdash;and
a small portion of transparent, colourless
diamonds showing crystalline structure.
Besides these there may be carbide of
silicon and corundum, arising from impurities
in the materials employed.</p>

<p>The residue is first heated for some hours
with strong sulphuric acid at the boiling-point,
with the cautious addition of powdered
nitre. It is then well washed and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
two days allowed to soak in strong hydrofluoric
acid in cold, then in boiling acid.
After this treatment the soft graphite disappears,
and most, if not all, the silicon
compounds have been destroyed. Hot
sulphuric acid is again applied to destroy
the fluorides, and the residue, well washed,
is attacked with a mixture of the strongest
nitric acid and powdered potassium chlorate,
kept warm&mdash;but not above 60° C., to avoid
explosions. This treatment must be repeated
six or eight times, when all the hard
graphite will gradually be dissolved and
little else left but graphitic oxide, diamond,
and the harder carbonado and boart. The
residue is fused for an hour in fluorhydrate
or fluoride of potassium, then boiled out in
water and again heated in sulphuric acid.
The well-washed grains which resist this
energetic treatment are dried, carefully
deposited on a slide, and examined under
the microscope. Along with numerous
pieces of black diamond are seen transparent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
colourless pieces, some amorphous, others
with a crystalline appearance. <a href="#P_120">Fig. 21 B</a>
shows one of these crystalline fragments.
Although many fragments of crystals occur,
it is remarkable I have never seen a complete
crystal. All appear shattered, as if on being
liberated from the intense pressure under
which they were formed they burst asunder.
I have singular evidence of this phenomenon.
A fine piece of artificial diamond, carefully
mounted by me on a microscopic slide,
exploded during the night and covered the
slide with fragments. Moissan’s crystals of
artificial diamond sometimes broke a few
weeks after their preparation, and some of
the diamonds which cracked weeks or even
months after their preparation showed
fissures covered with minute cubes. I have
explained that this bursting paroxysm is not
unknown at the Kimberley mines. So far,
all such artificial diamonds are microscopic.
The largest artificial diamond is less than
one millimetre across.</p>

<p>These laboratory diamonds burn in the
air before the blowpipe to carbonic acid.
In lustre, crystalline form, optical properties,
density, and hardness they are identical
with the natural stone.</p>

<p>In several cases Moissan separated ten
to fifteen microscopic diamonds from a
single ingot. The larger of these are about
0·75 mm. long, the octahedra being 0·2 mm.</p>

<p>Along with carbon, molten iron dissolves
other bodies which possess tinctorial powers.
We know of blue, green, pink, yellow, and
orange diamonds. One batch of iron might
contain an impurity colouring the stones
blue, another lot would tend towards the
formation of pink stones, another of green,
and so on. Cobalt, nickel, chromium, and
manganese, all metals present in the blue
ground, would produce these colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A New Formation of Diamond</span></h3>

<p>I have long speculated as to the possibility
of obtaining artificially such pressures and
temperatures as would fulfil the above
conditions. In their researches on the
gases from fired gunpowder and cordite,
Sir Frederick Abel and Sir Andrew Noble
obtained in closed steel cylinders pressures
as great as 95 tons to the square inch, and
temperatures as high as 4000° C. According
to a paper recently communicated to the
Royal Society, Sir Andrew Noble, exploding
cordite in closed vessels, has obtained a
pressure of 8000 atmospheres, or 50 tons
per square inch, with a temperature reaching
in all probability 5400° Ab.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have conditions favourable
for the liquefaction of carbon, and were the
time of explosion sufficient to allow the
reactions to take place, we should certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
expect to get the liquid carbon to solidify in
the crystalline state.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>By the kindness of Sir Andrew Noble I
have been enabled to work upon some of
the residues obtained in closed vessels after
explosions, and I have submitted them to
the same treatment that the granulated iron
had gone through. After weeks of patient
toil I removed the amorphous carbon, the
graphite, the silica,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and other constituents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the ash of cordite, and obtained a residue
among which, under the microscope, crystalline
particles could be distinguished.
Some of these particles, from their crystalline
appearance and double refraction,
were silicon carbide; others were probably
diamonds. The whole residue was dried
and fused at a good red heat in an excess of
potassium bifluoride, to which was added,
during fusion, 5 per cent of nitre. (Previous
experiments had shown me that this mixture
readily attacked and dissolved silicon
carbide; unfortunately it also attacks
diamond to a slight degree.) All the
operations of washing and acid treatment
were performed in a large platinum crucible
by decantation (except the preliminary
attack with nitric acid and potassium
chlorate, when a hard glass vessel was
used); the final result was washed into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
shallow watch-glass and the selection made
under the microscope. The residue, after
thorough washing and then heating in
fuming sulphuric acid, was washed, and
the largest crystalline particles picked out
and mounted.</p>

<p>From the treatment the residual crystals
had undergone, chemists will agree with me
that diamonds only could stand such an
ordeal; on submitting them to skilled
crystallographic authorities my opinion is
confirmed. Speaking of the largest crystal,
one eminent authority calls it “a diamond
showing octahedral planes with dark boundaries
due to high refracting index.” After
careful examination, another authority
writes of the same crystal diamond, “I
think one may safely say that the position
and angles of its faces, and of its cleavages,
the absence of birefringence, and the high
refractive index are all compatible with the
properties of the diamond crystallising in
the form of an octahedron. Others of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
remaining crystals, which show a similar
high refractive index, appeared to me to
present the same features.”</p>

<p>It would have been more conclusive had
I been able to get further evidence as to the
density and hardness of the crystals; but
from what I have already said I think there
is no doubt that in these closed vessel
explosions we have another method of
producing the diamond artificially.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs80 bold">THE NATURAL FORMATION OF THE DIAMOND</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">An hypothesis is of little value if it only
elucidates half a problem. Let us
see how far we can follow out the ferric
hypothesis to explain the volcanic pipes.
In the first place we must remember these
so-called volcanic vents are admittedly not
filled with the eruptive rocks, scoriaceous
fragments, etc., constituting the ordinary
contents of volcanic ducts.</p>

<p>Certain artificial diamonds present the
appearance of an elongated drop. I have
seen diamonds which have exactly the
appearance of drops of liquid separated in a
pasty condition and crystallised on cooling.
Diamonds are sometimes found with little
appearance of crystallisation, but with
rounded forms similar to those which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
liquid might assume if kept in the midst of
another liquid with which it would not mix.
Other drops of liquid carbon retained for
sufficient time above their melting-point
would coalesce with adjacent drops, and on
slow cooling would separate in the form of
large perfect crystals. Two drops, joining
after incipient crystallisation, might assume
the not uncommon form of interpenetrating
twin crystals.</p>

<p>Many circumstances point to the conclusion
that the diamond of the chemist and
the diamond of the mine are strangely akin
as to origin. It is evident that the diamond
has not been formed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i> in the blue
ground. The genesis must have taken place
at vast depths under enormous pressure.
The explosion of large diamonds on coming
to the surface shows extreme tension. More
diamonds are found in fragments and
splinters than in perfect crystals; and it is
noteworthy that although these splinters
and fragments must be derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
breaking up of a large crystal, yet in only
one instance have pieces been found which
could be fitted together, and these occurred
at different levels. Does not this fact point
to the conclusion that the blue ground is
not their true matrix? Nature does not
make fragments of crystals. As the edges
of the crystals are still sharp and unabraded,
the <em>locus</em> of formation cannot have been
very distant from the present sites. There
were probably many sites of crystallisation
differing in place and time, or we should not
see such distinctive characters in the gems
from different mines, nor indeed in the
diamonds from different parts of the same
mine.</p>

<p>I start with the reasonable supposition
that at a sufficient depth<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> there were
masses of molten iron at great pressure and
high temperature, holding carbon in solution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ready to crystallise out on cooling. Far
back in time the cooling from above caused
cracks in superjacent strata through which
water<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> found its way. On reaching the
incandescent iron the water would be converted
into gas, and this gas would rapidly
disintegrate and erode the channels through
which it passed, grooving a passage more and
more vertical in the necessity to find the
quickest vent to the surface. But steam in
the presence of molten or even red-hot iron
liberates large volumes of hydrogen gas,
together with less quantities of hydrocarbons<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
of all kinds&mdash;liquid, gaseous, and
solid. Erosion commenced by steam would
be continued by the other gases; it would
be easy for pipes, large as any found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
South Africa, to be scored out in this
manner.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Noble has shown that when
the screw stopper of his steel cylinders in
which gunpowder explodes under pressure
is not absolutely perfect, gas escapes with a
rush so overpowering and a temperature so
high as to score a wide channel in the metal.
To illustrate my argument Sir Andrew
Noble has been kind enough to try a special
experiment. Through a cylinder of granite
he drilled a hole 0·2 inch diameter, the size
of a small vent. This was made the stopper of
an explosion chamber, in which a quantity of
cordite was fired, the gases escaping through
the granite vent. The pressure was about
1500 atmospheres and the whole time of
escape was less than half a second. The
erosion produced by the escaping gases and
by the heat of friction scored out a channel
more than half an inch diameter and melted
the granite along the course. If steel and
granite are thus vulnerable at comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
moderate gaseous pressure, it is easy
to imagine the destructive upburst of hydrogen
and water-gas, grooving for itself a
channel in the diabase and quartzite, tearing
fragments from resisting rocks, covering the
country with debris, and finally, at the subsidence
of the great rush, filling the self-made
pipe with a water-borne magma in
which rocks, minerals, iron oxide, shale,
petroleum, and diamonds are violently
churned in a veritable witch’s cauldron!
As the heat abated the water vapour would
gradually give place to hot water, which,
forced through the magma, would change
some of the mineral fragments into the
existing forms of to-day.</p>

<p>Each outbreak would form a dome-shaped
hill; the eroding agency of water
and ice would plane these eminences until
all traces of the original pipes were lost.</p>

<p>Actions such as I have described need
not have taken place simultaneously. As
there must have been many molten masses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of iron with variable contents of carbon,
different kinds of colouring matter, solidifying
with varying degrees of rapidity,
and coming in contact with water at intervals
throughout long periods of geological
time&mdash;so must there have been many outbursts
and upheavals, giving rise to pipes
containing diamonds. And these diamonds,
by sparseness of distribution, crystalline
character, difference of tint, purity of
colour, varying hardness, brittleness, and
state of tension, have the story of their
origin impressed upon them, engraved by
natural forces&mdash;a story which future generations
of scientific men may be able to interpret
with greater precision than is possible
to-day.</p>

<span class="fs80 bold">METEORIC DIAMONDS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Sensational as is the story of the
diamond industry in South Africa,
quite another aspect fixes the attention of
the chemist. The diamonds come out of
the mines, but how did they get in? How
were they formed? What is their origin?</p>

<p>Gardner Williams, who knows more about
diamonds than any man living, is little
inclined to indulge in speculation. In his
fascinating book he frankly says:</p>

<p>“I have been frequently asked, ‘What is
your theory of the original crystallisation of
the diamond?’ and the answer has always
been, ‘I have none; for after seventeen
years of thoughtful study, coupled with
practical research, I find that it is easier to
“drive a coach and four” through most
theories that have been propounded than to
suggest one which would be based on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
non-assailable data.’ All that can be said is
that in some unknown manner carbon, which
existed deep down in the internal regions of
the earth, was changed from its black and
uninviting appearance to the most beautiful
gem which ever saw the light of day.”</p>

<p>Another diamond theory appeals to the
imagination. It is said the diamond is a
gift from Heaven, conveyed to earth in
meteoric showers. The suggestion, I believe,
was first broached by A. Meydenbauer,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
who says, “The diamond can only be of
cosmic origin, having fallen as a meteorite
at later periods of the earth’s formation.
The available localities of the diamond
contain the residues of not very compact
meteoric masses which may, perhaps, have
fallen in prehistoric ages, and which have
penetrated more or less deeply, according
to the more or less resistant character of the
surface where they fell. Their remains are
crumbling away on exposure to the air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sun, and the rain has long ago washed
away all prominent masses. The enclosed
diamonds have remained scattered in the
river beds, while the fine light matrix has
been swept away.”</p>

<p>According to this hypothesis, the so-called
volcanic pipes are simply holes bored in the
solid earth by the impact of monstrous
meteors&mdash;the larger masses boring the holes,
while the smaller masses, disintegrating in
their fall, distributed diamonds broadcast.
Bizarre as such a theory appears, I am
bound to say there are many circumstances
which show that the notion of the heavens
raining diamonds is not impossible.</p>

<p>The most striking confirmation of the
meteoric theory comes from Arizona. Here,
on a broad open plain, over an area about
five miles in diameter, have been scattered
one or two thousand masses of metallic
iron, the fragments varying in weight from
half a ton to a fraction of an ounce. There
is no doubt these masses formed part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
meteoric shower, although no record exists
as to when the fall took place. Curiously
enough, near the centre, where most of the
meteorites have been found, is a crater with
raised edges three-quarters of a mile in
diameter and about 600 feet deep, bearing
exactly the appearance which would be
produced had a mighty mass of iron struck
the ground and buried itself deep under the
surface. Altogether, ten tons of this iron
have been collected, and specimens of the
Canyon Diablo meteorite are in most collectors’
cabinets.</p>

<p>An ardent mineralogist&mdash;the late Dr.
Foote&mdash;cutting a section of this meteorite,
found the tools were injured by something
vastly harder than metallic iron. He
examined the specimen chemically, and soon
after announced to the scientific world that
the Canyon Diablo meteorite contained
black and transparent diamonds. This
startling discovery was afterwards verified
by Professors Moissan and Friedel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Moissan, working on 183 kilogrammes of
the Canyon Diablo meteorite, has recently
found smooth black diamonds and transparent
diamonds in the form of octahedra
with rounded edges, together with green,
hexagonal crystals of carbon silicide. The
presence of carbon silicide in the meteorite
shows that it must at some time have
experienced the temperature of the electric
furnace. Since this revelation the search
for diamonds in meteorites has occupied the
attention of chemists all over the world.</p>

<p><a href="#P_138">Fig. 23 A, C, and D</a>, are reproductions of
photographs of true diamonds I myself have
extracted from the Canyon Diablo meteorite.</p>

<p>Under atmospheric influences the iron
would rapidly oxidise and rust away,
colouring the adjacent soil with red oxide
of iron. The meteoric diamonds would be
unaffected and left on the surface of the
soil, to be found haphazard when oxidation
had removed the last proof of their celestial
origin. That there are still lumps of iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
left at Arizona is merely due to the extreme
dryness of the climate and the comparatively
short time that the iron has been on our
planet. We are here witnesses to the course
of an event which may have happened in
geologic times anywhere on the earth’s
surface.</p>

<p>Although in Arizona diamonds have
fallen from the skies, confounding our
senses, this descent of precious stones is
what may be called a freak of nature rather
than a normal occurrence. To the modern
student of science there is no great difference
between the composition of our earth and
that of extra-terrestrial masses. The mineral
peridot is a constant extra-terrestrial visitor,
present in most meteorites. And yet no one
doubts that peridot is also a true constituent
of rocks formed on this earth. The spectroscope
reveals that the elementary composition
of the stars and the earth are pretty
much the same; and the spectroscope also
shows that meteorites have as much of earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as of heaven in their composition. Indeed,
not only are the selfsame elements present
in meteorites, but they are combined in the
same way to form the same minerals as in
the crust of the earth.</p>

<p>It is certain from observations I have
made, corroborated by experience gained
in the laboratory, that iron at a high temperature
and under great pressure&mdash;conditions
existent at great depths below the
surface of the earth&mdash;acts as the long-sought
solvent for carbon, and will allow it to
crystallise out in the form of diamond. But
it is also certain, from the evidence afforded
by the Arizona and other meteorites, that
similar conditions have existed among
bodies in space, and that on more than one
occasion a meteorite freighted with jewels
has fallen as a star from the sky.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> According to Gardner Williams the South African
carat is equivalent to 3·174 grains. In Latimer Clark’s
<cite>Dictionary of Metric and other Useful Measures</cite> the
diamond carat is given as equal to 3·1683 grains =
0·2053 gramme = 4 diamond grains; 1 diamond grain =
0·792 troy grain; 151·5 diamond carats = 1 ounce troy.
</p>
<p>
Webster’s <cite>International Dictionary</cite> gives the diamond
carat as equal to 3⅕ troy grains.
</p>
<p>
<cite>The Oxford English Dictionary</cite> says the carat was
originally <sup>1</sup>/<sub>144</sub> of an ounce, or 3⅓ grains, but now equal
to about 3⅕ grains, though varying slightly with time
and place.
</p>
<p>
The <cite>Century Dictionary</cite> says the diamond carat is
equal to about 3⅙ troy grains, and adds that in 1877
the weight of the carat was fixed by a syndicate of
London, Paris, and Amsterdam jewellers at 205 milligrammes.
This would make the carat equal to 3·163 troy
grains. A law has been passed in France ordaining
that in the purchase or sale of diamonds and other
precious stones the term “metric carat” shall be employed
to designate a weight of 200 milligrammes
(3·086 grains troy), and prohibiting the use of the word
carat to designate any other weight.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Sir James Dewar, in a Friday evening discourse
at the Royal Institution in 1880, showed an experiment
proving that the temperature of the interior of
a carbon tube heated by an outside electric arc was
higher than that of the oxy-hydrogen flame. He
placed a few small crystals of diamond in the carbon
tube, and, maintaining a current of hydrogen to prevent
oxidation, raised the temperature of the tube in
an electric furnace to that of the arc. In a few
minutes the diamond was transformed into graphite.
At first sight this would seem to show that diamond
cannot be formed at temperatures above that of the
arc. It is probable, however, for reasons given above,
that at exceedingly high pressures the result would be
different.</p></div>
